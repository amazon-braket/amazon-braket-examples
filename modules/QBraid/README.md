# Getting started with Braket through qBraid

[QBraid](https://www.qbraid.com/) is a cloud-based platform for quantum computing, providing researchers and developers with software tools and access to quantum hardware. Offering cross-framework quantum program abstraction, transpilation, and execution features through its SDK, qBraid helps to make quantum computing development process easier.

[With the recent integration of the SDK with Amazon Braket on "qBraid Lab"](https://www.qbraid.com/blog/qbraid-announces-qbraid-sdk-integrated-with-amazon-braket), qBraid's web-based IDE cross JupyterLab interface, Amazon Braket users are able to take advantage of the qBraid SDK's "write-once-and-submit" functionality. The qBraid integration also encourages accessibility for Braket newcomers by allowing Qiskit circuits to be run on Braket devices without having to rewrite the circuit using the Braket SDK and by providing an efficient way of switching circuits among multiple quantum computing frameworks without needing to possess a robust understanding of OpenQASM.

As such, those looking for a streamlined onboarding process to Braket may be interested in utilizing qBraid as an intermediary platform. In particular, educators are likely to benefit from incorporating qBraid Lab into their curriculum, as it helps to facilitate the standardization of students' development environments and eliminates the need of familiarization with the Braket SDK for the purposes of the course.

To create a qBraid account and set up qBraid Lab, follow the [Lab User Guide](https://docs.qbraid.com/en/latest/lab/overview.html) on the [qBraid documentation](https://docs.qbraid.com/en/latest/index.html).

Once you have set up your environment, get familiarized with the qBraid SDK with the [SDK User Guide](https://docs.qbraid.com/en/latest/sdk/overview.html) and [SDK API Reference](https://docs.qbraid.com/en/latest/api/qbraid.html).
