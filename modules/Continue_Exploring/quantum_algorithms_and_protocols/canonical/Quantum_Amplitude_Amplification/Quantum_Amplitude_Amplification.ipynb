    "In the lines that follow, we provide a pictorial derivation of QAA, giving an intuitive background to the derivation shown here. \n",
    "Consider a unitary $\\mathcal{A}$ acting on $(n+1)$ qubits as follows \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1} = |\\psi\\rangle = \\sqrt{a} |G\\rangle |1\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-a} |B\\rangle |0\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a \\in [0,1]$ is the amplitude we wish to amplify. \n",
    "Setting $\\sqrt{a} = \\sin(\\theta)$, equivalently we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1} = |\\psi\\rangle = \\sin(\\theta) |G\\rangle |1\\rangle + \\cos(\\theta) |B\\rangle |0\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have introduced the $n$-qubit states $|G\\rangle$ and $|B\\rangle$ by convention referred to as _good_ and _bad_ states, respectively. \n",
    "The states $|\\psi_{1}\\rangle = |G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_{0}\\rangle = |B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ are (unique) projections of the original state $|\\psi\\rangle$ into good and bad subspaces, denoted as $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{0}$, respectively. Note that $|\\psi_{1}\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_{0}\\rangle$ are orthogonal, i.e., $ \\langle \\psi_{0}|\\psi_{1}\\rangle = \\langle B|G\\rangle \\langle 0|1\\rangle =0$, because $\\langle 0|1\\rangle =0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Goal of QAA__: The goal of the algorithm is then to evolve the initial state $|\\psi \\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}$ into a state with a higher overlap with the _good_ subspace $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$ by _amplifying_ the amplitude of the $|\\psi_{1}\\rangle$ component of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplification process that follows boosts the amplitude of the good state $|G\\rangle$ from $\\sin(\\theta)$ to $\\sin((2m+1)\\theta)$ with $2m$ denoting the number of _queries_ or applications of the unitary $\\mathcal{A}$. The probability of finding a _good_ outcome is maximized when $m=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\pi}{4\\theta}\\right\\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Procedure of QAA__: Rather than directly taking measurements on $|\\psi\\rangle$ (as prepared by a _single_ application of $\\mathcal{A}$), QAA proceeds by applying the following operator $\\mathcal{Q}$ (that is derived from $\\mathcal{A}$, i.e., taking $\\mathcal{A}$ as an input), \n",

    "is a reflection about $|0\\rangle_{n+1}$ (leaving the all-zero state $|0\\rangle_{n+1}$ untouched while giving a minus sign to all other states) and similarly \n",
    "$\\mathcal{R}_{B} = \\mathbb{1} - 2 |G\\rangle |1\\rangle \\langle 1|\\langle G|$ \n",
    "is a reflection about $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$, giving a negative sign on the good state, as $\\mathcal{R}_{B} |G\\rangle |1\\rangle = -1|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$, while leaving the bad state $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ untouched.\n",
    "Finally, $\\mathcal{A}^{\\dagger}$ denotes the adjoint of $\\mathcal{A}$. \n",
    "As demonstrated in Refs.[[2,3]](#References), repeated application of the operator $\\mathcal{Q}$ ($m$-times) on $|\\psi\\rangle = \\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1}$ gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{Q}^{m} |\\psi\\rangle = \\mathcal{Q}^{m}\\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1} = \\sin((2m+1)\\theta) |G\\rangle |1\\rangle + \\cos((2m+1)\\theta) |B\\rangle |0\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, this equation shows that, for small values of the unknown parameter $a$, the repeated application of $Q$ (involving $2m$ queries of $\\mathcal{A}$ in total) yields a state for which the desired good state would be measured with a probability at least $4m^{2}$ times larger than that of a naive strategy as obtained from $\\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1}$. \n",
    "This result is because the probability of measuring the good state $|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ is $P_{1}=\\sin^{2}((2m+1)\\theta) \\approx (2m+1)^{2}\\theta^{2}>4m^{2} \\theta^{2}$. \n",
    "Compare this to $2m$ naive queries, i.e., $2m$ measurements from copies of the state $\\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1}$ which gives the good state with linear increase in probability $2m$. \n",
    "This reasoning is at the heart of the quadratic speedup obtained with QAA: the probability of measuring the good state after QAA scales quadratically with $m$ instead of linearly, meaning we only need $O(\\sqrt{m})$ queries of $\\mathcal{A}$ to achieve the same probability of measuring $|G\\rangle$ compared to the classical strategy. \n",
    "Specifically, if $(2m+1)\\theta \\approx \\pi/2$, we have amplified the success probability to $\\sin(...)^{2} \\approx 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\mathcal{A}$ is an input to QAA that we assume is given, our goal is to figure out how to implement $\\mathcal{R}_{B}$, $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$, and $\\mathcal{A}^{\\dagger}$ as unitaries in a quantum circuit.\n",

    "Going from left to right in the image above, the QAA routine proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Original situation__: First, the original state prepared by $\\mathcal{A}$ as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\mathcal{A}|0\\rangle _{n+1} = \\sin(\\theta) |G\\rangle |1\\rangle + \\cos(\\theta) |B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ resides in the two-dimensional plane spanned by the basis vectors $|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ and $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$, respectively, with (typically small) projection $\\sin(\\theta)$ onto the $|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ axis.\n",
    "2. __Reflection about $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$__: We then apply a reflection around $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$, transforming $|\\psi\\rangle$ to $|\\psi'\\rangle$, keeping the projection along $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ unchanged, but adding a minus sign to the $|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ component. Reflection about $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ means that all terms apart from $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ pick up a negative sign. Because there are only two terms, only $|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ picks up a negative sign, which is accomplished by the operator $\\mathcal{R}_{B} = \\mathbb{1} - 2 |G\\rangle |1\\rangle \\langle 1|\\langle G|$, as defined previously. \n",
    "3. __Reflection about $|\\psi\\rangle$__: Finally, we apply a reflection around the original state $|\\psi\\rangle$, giving the final state $|\\psi''\\rangle$, with an amplified $|G\\rangle |1\\rangle$ amplitude of $\\sin(3\\theta)$, adding an angle of $2\\theta$ from the rotation around $|\\psi\\rangle$ to the original angle $\\theta$.\n",
    "Reflection about $|\\psi\\rangle$ means that all terms except for $|\\psi\\rangle$ pick up a minus sign, as can be done by applying the operator $\\mathcal{R}_{\\psi} = 2|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi| - \\mathbb{1}$. \n",
    "Using the definition $|\\psi\\rangle = \\mathcal{A}|\\vec{0}\\rangle$ and conversely $\\langle \\psi | = \\langle \\vec{0}|\\mathcal{A}^{\\dagger}$ as well as the unitarity condition $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{A}^{\\dagger}=\\mathbb{1}$, this reflection can be rewritten as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\psi} = \\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{R}_{0}\\mathcal{A}^{\\dagger}$, where $\\mathcal{R}_{0}=2|\\vec{0}\\rangle\\langle\\vec{0}| - \\mathbb{1}$ is a reflection about the all-zero state $|\\vec{0}\\rangle$ where all terms except for $|\\vec{0}\\rangle$ pick up a minus sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence completes one cycle of the QAA routine, that is one application of $\\mathcal{Q}$. \n",
    "In total, each application of $Q$ involves two reflections, first through $|B\\rangle |0\\rangle$ and then through $|\\psi\\rangle$. \n",
    "The product is a rotation with angle $2\\theta$. \n",
    "Based on our analysis above we can write the rotation $\\mathcal{Q}$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{Q} = \\mathcal{R}_{\\psi}\\mathcal{R}_{B} = \\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{R}_{0}\\mathcal{A}^{\\dagger}\\mathcal{R}_{B},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "thereby confirming the formal definition above. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Obtaining a quantum speedup__:\n",
    "To see that QAA indeed provides a quantum speedup, suppose we use it to query an unsorted database with $N$ elements and $G$ _good_ elements. \n",
    "The classical algorithm for finding good entries is to query each element in the database until a good one is found. Thus, the classical solution requires $O(N/G)$ queries. \n",
    "A quantum solution would be to query the database in superposition using the state $1/\\sqrt{N}\\sum_i|j\\rangle$, where $j$ enumerates the $N$ elements of the database. \n",
    "The oracle prepares the state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{N}} |G\\rangle |1\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{N-G}{N}} |B\\rangle |0\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $\\sqrt{a}=\\sin(\\theta)=\\sqrt{G/N}$ and $\\theta \\approx \\sqrt{G/N}$ for the typical scenario where $\\theta \\ll 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then apply the QAA algorithm to amplify the amplitude of the good states, such that the probability of obtaining a _good_ outcome is amplified. \n",
    "To ensure that we measure a good outcome with high probability, we apply the Grover iterator $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\pi}{4\\theta}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{N}{G}}\\right\\rfloor$ times. \n",
    "In other words, we only need to query the oracle $O(\\sqrt{N/G})$ times in order to find a good outcome to the search problem with high probability.\n",
    "This outcome is a quadratic improvement over the $O(N/G)$ oracle calls required classically. "

    "Since the ancilla qubits are initialized in $|0, 0, ...\\rangle$ and are uncomputed back to their initial state in the last step of the algorithm, we can find the amplitude of a given bitstring on the register qubits by padding that target bitstring (for example, $11$ in our example) with the right number ($N-1$) of zeros. \n",
