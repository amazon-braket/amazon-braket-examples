    "The advantage of such quantum random number generators over implementations based on classical technologies is that the outcomes are intrinsically random. That is, according to the laws of quantum physics, the outcome of the measurement is not only hard to predict, but rather impossible to know before the measurement has taken place.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since current quantum processing units are noisy to a certain degree, there are at least three potential problems that need to be addressed:\n",
    "* First, the noise acting on all states and operations performed might lead to a systematic bias towards the probability of getting the measurement outcomes $0$ or $1$, respectively.\n",
    "* Second, even if aforementioned noise is not biased towards certain measurement outcomes, the generated randomness is no longer solely based on intrinsically random quantum effects, but rather partly on the noise present.\n",
    "* Third, whereas by the laws of quantum physics a pure quantum state cannot be correlated to the outside world, any noisy acting on the system corresponds to information leaking to the environment. This is because no information is destroyed in quantum physics and hence, a malicious third party knowing about the noise occurring will be able to guess the generated bits (at least up to a certain degree).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the noise model acting on the quantum processor units is characterized to some degree (e.g., by means of previous benchmarking), these shortcomings can be overcome by employing two independent quantum processor units, together with an appropriate classical post-processing. The latter is based on classical algorithms from the theory of pseudo-randomness, so-called two-source extractors. This is what we discuss next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we refer a few times to the theory paper [1] that features formal cryptographic security definitions, together with mathematical proofs, as well as some statistical methods tailored to intermediate scale quantum devices. These pointers can be safely ignored when only interested in the implementation of our QRNG.\n",

For example, for $n$-bit distributions $X$ we have $H_{\\min}(X)\\in[0,n]$, where $0$ corresponds to a deterministic distribution containing no randomness and $n$ to the perfectly random, uniform distribution.\n",

    "A two-source extractor is a function $\\text{Ext}:\\{0,1\\}^{n_1}\\times\\{0,1\\}^{n_2}\\to\\{0,1\\}^m$ such that for any two independent sources with min-entropy at least $H_{\\min}(X_1)\\geq k_1$ and $H_{\\min}(X_2)\\geq k_2$, respectively, the output of length $m$ is $\\epsilon\\in[0,1]$ close in variational distance to the perfectly random, uniform distribution $U_M$ of size $m$:\n",

This is also how we will evaluate the conditional min-entropy quantity later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, a quantum-proof two-source extractor is then function $\\text{Ext}:\\{0,1\\}^{n_1}\\times\\{0,1\\}^{n_2}\\to\\{0,1\\}^m$ such that for any two independent sources with quantum conditional min-entropy at least $H_{\\min}(X_1|Q_1)\\geq k_1$ and $H_{\\min}(X_2|Q_2)\\geq k_2$, respectively, we have for $\\epsilon\\in[0,1]$ in quantum variational distance\n",

Such a so-called (semi) device-independent scheme is for example given in [3], with a corresponding implementation in Amazon Braket [7].
