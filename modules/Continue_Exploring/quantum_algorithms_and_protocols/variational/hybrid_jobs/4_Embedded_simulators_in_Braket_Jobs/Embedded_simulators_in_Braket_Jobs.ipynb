    "In this notebook, we introduce embedded simulators in Braket Jobs. An embedded simulator is a local simulator that runs completely within a job instance, i.e., the compute resource that is running your algorithm script. In contrast, [on-demand simulators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html#braket-simulator-sv1), such as SV1, DM1, or TN1, calculate the results of a quantum circuit on dedicated compute infrastructure on-demand by Amazon Braket. At a high level, hybrid workloads usually consist of iterations of quantum circuit executions and variational parameter optimizations. By using embedded simulators, we keep all computations in the same environment. This allows the optimization algorithm to access advanced features supported by the embedded simulator. For example, users could leverage advanced gradient computation methods, such as [the adjoint and the backprop method](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/interfaces.html#simulation-based-differentiation), for supported simulators via PennyLane. These methods rely on accessing the intermediate states of the wave function, which is not supported by Amazon Braket on-demand simulators or QPUs. Furthermore, with the [Bring Your Own Container (BYOC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-byoc.html) feature of Jobs, users may choose to use open source simulators or their own proprietary simulation tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to running a local simulator in a manually set up [Amazon EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or in a user's local environment, Hybrid Jobs manage the computational resources on your behalf. A job instance is automatically started when the job is created, and is ended when the job is finished, so you only pay for the resources you use. Users can submit multiple jobs at the same time to accelerate experimentation, e.g., during hyperparameter optimization. In addition, users can switch from an embedded simulator to other Amazon Braket devices, including QPUs, by changing the selected device when creating a job."

    "## Debug with local mode\n",
    "It is often useful to debug your program locally before submitting a job. You can run jobs with embedded simulation locally in your own environment for faster testing and debugging. This feature requires Docker to be installed in your programming environment. Amazon Braket notebooks have Docker pre-installed, but if you want to test your code locally, say, on your laptop, you need to install Docker. You can for instance follow these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In local mode, a container is created in your local environment and the algorithm is run in that container. To run a job in local mode, make sure the Docker daemon is running, which is already the case for when you use Amazon Braket notebook instances. Then, create a `LocalQuantumJob` instead of an `AwsQuantumJob`. Local jobs always run synchronously and display the logs, so there is no `wait_until_complete` argument. Because a job in local mode runs in your own environment, there is no `instance_config` argument.  When a local job is created for the first time, it will take longer because it needs to build the container. The subsequent runs will be faster. Note that local jobs will not be visible in the Amazon Braket Console.  In local mode, you can still send quantum tasks to actual devices, but you do not get the performance benefits when running against an actual QPU while in local mode. To learn more about local mode, see the [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-local-mode.html)."
