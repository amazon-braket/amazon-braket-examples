    "In order to determine the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian of a molecule given in Eq.

    "The many-electron wavefunction is expressed as a [Slater determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater_determinant) of these basis functions, i.e., as an antisymmetrized product of the single-electron basis functions, so that the electrons automatically satisfy the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle).\n",
    "While the total number of single-electron basis functions considered $M$, is typically larger than the total number of electrons $N$, in the molecule, the $N$ electrons can only occupy $N$ ($< M$) of these orbitals in a Slater determinant, i.e., a Slater determinant contains only $N$ occupied orbitals [1].\n",
    "Since any Slater determinant of the basis functions is uniquely determined by which orbitals are occupied, a Slater determinant can be represented in an abstract vector space, called the *Fock space*, by an *occupation number* vector $|f\\rangle = |f_{M-1}, \\ldots, f_0 \\rangle$ where each $f_i$ is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the $i$-th orbitals is unoccupied or occupied respectively in the Slater determinant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we introduce a set of operators $\\{a_p, a_p^\\dagger\\}$ , called the fermion *annihilation* and *creation* operators respectively, corresponding to each of the basis functions $\\{\\phi_p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\}$, which satisfy the anticommutation relations,\n",

    "### Jordan-Wigner encoding\n",
    "In the Jordan-Wigner (JW) encoding, we store the occupation number of an orbital $f_i$ in the $i$-th qubit $q_i$ as either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ depending on whether the orbital is unoccupied or occupied respectively.\n",

    "This shows that in the JW encoding, while the occupation of an orbital is stored locally, i.e., in a single qubit, the parity is stored non-locally.\n",

    "VQE is based on the Raleigh-Ritz variational principle: for a trial wavefunction $|\\psi(\\vec{\\theta})\\rangle$ parameterized by a vector parameter $\\vec{\\theta}$ for a system with Hamiltonian $H$, whose lowest energy eigenvalue is $E_0$ [2],\n",
