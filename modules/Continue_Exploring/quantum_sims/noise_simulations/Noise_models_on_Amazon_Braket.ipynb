    "## What is a noise model? \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum devices and QPUs are subject noise on qubits and gate operations due to imperfect control.\n",
    "The presence of noise deteriorates the quality of a quantum computation, especially when creating highly-entangled states. \n",
    "Understanding the source and magnitude of this noise is essential to debugging and improving quantum computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general noise on a quantum device is modelled as a noise channel (see [Simulating Noise On Amazon Braket](./Simulating_Noise_On_Amazon_Braket.ipynb)). The size of the full noise channel for a QPU scales exponentially with the number of qubits. Accordingly, it is essential to place assumptions on the noise channel to make it practical to simulate and debug circuits of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A noise model encapsulates the assumptions on quantum noise channels and how they act on a given circuit. \n",
    "Simulating this noisy circuit gives information about much the noise impacts the results of the quantum computation. \n",
    "By incrementally adjusting the noise model, the impact of noise can be understood on a variety of quantum algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding realistic and accurate noise models for quantum devices is a active field of research. \n",
    "While simple models that treat each qubit or gate independently are useful, the effects of non-local crosstalk are often the most important when using multi-qubit devices. "
