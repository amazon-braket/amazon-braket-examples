    "Quantum-classical hybrid optimization of quantum circuits is the workhorse algorithm of near-term quantum computing. It is not only fundamental for training variational quantum circuits but also more broadly for applications like quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning and, of course, for applications in \"vanilla\" quantum optimization. Today’s most powerful optimization algorithms rely on the efficient computation of gradients—which tell us how to adapt parameters a little bit at a time to improve the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training quantum circuits is tough! Each step during optimization requires evaluation of the circuit gradient. Calculating the gradient involves multiple device executions: for each trainable parameter we must execute our circuit on the device typically [more than once](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift.html). Reasonable applications involve many trainable parameters (just think of a classical neural net with millions of tunable weights). The result is a huge number of device executions for each optimization step.\n",

    "In the ``braket.local.qubit`` device, gradients are calculated in PennyLane through sequential device executions—in other words, all these circuits have to wait in the same queue until they can be evaluated. This approach is simpler, but quickly becomes slow as we scale the number of parameters. Moreover, as the number of qubits, or \"width\", of the circuit is scaled, each device execution will slow down and eventually become a noticeable bottleneck. In short—**the future of training quantum circuits relies on high-performance remote simulators and hardware devices that are highly parallelized**. "
