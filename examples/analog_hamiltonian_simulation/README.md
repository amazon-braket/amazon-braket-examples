Notebook 00 provides an introduction to Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS), a quantum computing paradigm different from gate-based computing.

Notebook 01 introduces QuEra's Aquila device.

Notebook 02 introduces shows how to prepare ordered phases on 1D and 2D lattices, one of the canonical use cases for Rydberg atom devices.

Notebook 03 introduces how to parallelize tasks on QuEra's Aquila device.

Notebook 04 introduces how to solve the Maximum independent set problem, another canonical use case for Rydberg atom devices.

Notebook 05 introduces several features supported by the AHS local simulator.

Notebook 06 shows how to use quantum machine learning techniques from PennyLane to optimize the AHS program.

Notebook 07 shows how to prepare a specific initial state, using local detuning, to simulate the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory.

Notebook 08 shows how to solve the maximum weight independent set problem using local detuning

Notebook 09 introduce how to run noise simulation for the Rydberg atom device
