    "Random numbers are a ubiquitous resource in computation and cryptography. For example, in security, random numbers are crucial to creating keys for encryption. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs), that make use of the inherent unpredictability in quantum physics, promise enhanced security compared to standard cryptographic pseudo-random number generators (CPRNGs) based on classical technologies.\n",

    "In this notebook, we implement our own QRNG. Namely, we program two separate quantum processor units (QPUs) from different suppliers in Amazon Braket to supply two streams of weakly random bits. We then show how to generate physically secure randomness from these two weak sources by means of classical post-processing based on randomness extractors. The prerequisites for the tutorial are a basic understanding of quantum states, quantum measurements, and quantum channels. For a detailed explanation of these concepts we refer to the Amazon Braket notebook [Simulating noise on Amazon Braket](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/braket_features/Simulating_Noise_On_Amazon_Braket.ipynb).\n",

    "The advantage of such quantum random number generators over implementations based on classical technologies is that the outcomes are intrinsically random. That is, according to the laws of quantum physics, the outcome of the measurement is not only hard to predict, but rather impossible to know before the measurement has taken place.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since current quantum processing units are noisy to a certain degree, there are at least three potential problems that need to be addressed:\n",
    "* First, the noise acting on all states and operations performed might lead to a systematic bias towards the probability of getting the measurement outcomes $0$ or $1$, respectively.\n",
    "* Second, even if aforementioned noise is not biased towards certain measurement outcomes, the generated randomness is no longer solely based on intrinsically random quantum effects, but rather partly on the noise present.\n",
    "* Third, whereas by the laws of quantum physics a pure quantum state cannot be correlated to the outside world, any noisy acting on the system corresponds to information leaking to the environment. This is because no information is destroyed in quantum physics and hence, a malicious third party knowing about the noise occurring will be able to guess the generated bits (at least up to a certain degree).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the noise model acting on the quantum processor units is characterized to some degree (e.g., by means of previous benchmarking), these shortcomings can be overcome by employing two independent quantum processor units, together with an appropriate classical post-processing. The latter is based on classical algorithms from the theory of pseudo-randomness, so-called two-source extractors. This is what we discuss next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we refer a few times to the theory paper [1] that features formal cryptographic security definitions, together with mathematical proofs, as well as some statistical methods tailored to intermediate scale quantum devices. These pointers can be safely ignored when only interested in the implementation of our QRNG.\n",

    "Two-source extractors allow distillation of physically secure random bits from two independent weak sources of randomness whenever they are sufficiently unpredictable to start with.

For example, for $n$-bit distributions $X$ we have $H_{\\min}(X)\\in[0,n]$, where $0$ corresponds to a deterministic distribution containing no randomness and $n$ to the perfectly random, uniform distribution.\n",

    "A two-source extractor is a function $\\text{Ext}:\\{0,1\\}^{n_1}\\times\\{0,1\\}^{n_2}\\to\\{0,1\\}^m$ such that for any two independent sources with min-entropy at least $H_{\\min}(X_1)\\geq k_1$ and $H_{\\min}(X_2)\\geq k_2$, respectively, the output of length $m$ is $\\epsilon\\in[0,1]$ close in variational distance to the perfectly random, uniform distribution $U_M$ of size $m$:\n",

    "Generally, for any given quantum processing unit, the supplier typically publishes some type of noise specification with it. This includes both, the noise characterization of state preparation, as well as the read-out measurements. In case such specifications are not available, or if one wants to double check them, it is in principle possible to benchmark the device. We refer to the theory notes [1] for more details on this and just mention here that we do not need a full characterization of the device, but rather only conservative upper bounds on the noise strength. This then translates into lower bounds on the min-entropy present in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case, since we are only applying single qubit gates for our Hadamard circuit, the noise is captured well by single qubit noise models. Moreover, for the state preparation step via Hadamard gates, the typical noise in quantum architectures is uniform, depolarizing noise of some strength $\\lambda\\in[0,1]$. That is, all possible single qubit errors such as bit flip or phase flip errors are equally likely, leading to the effective evolution\n",

Such a so-called (semi) device-independent scheme is for example given in [3], with a corresponding implementation in Amazon Braket [7].
