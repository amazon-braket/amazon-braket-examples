    "The next step of this tutorial is to decompose this Hamiltonian into a series of Kronecker products of Pauli matrices (Pauli products) so that this problem can be more digestible to a quantum algorithm. One pleasant feature of using Kronecker products of Pauli and identity matrices is that you can decompose any matrix into a sum of these products multiplied by a constant. If we define a three dimensional matrix composed of the three Pauli matrices and a $2×2$ identity matrix as such: $σ~=(I,σ_x,σ_y,σ_z)$, then for our three qubit system, we can define our Hamiltonian as: $H=\\frac{1}{N}∑_{i,j,k} h_{i,j,k} \\tilde{\\sigma}_i⊗\\tilde{\\sigma}_j⊗\\tilde{\\sigma}_k$. Here, $N=2n$ where $n$ is the number of qubits, the subscripts on $σ~$ determine the Pauli matrix or identity matrix of interest, and the summation takes into account all possible combinations of Pauli and identity matrices in the Kronecker product. The term $h_{i,j,k}$ is given by the equation: $h_{i,j,k}=TR(\\tilde{σ}_i⊗\\tilde{σ}_j⊗\\tilde{σ}_k H)$. This is implemented with the following code:\n"

    "The time evolution of a wave function is normally done with the following equation: $∣Ψ(t)⟩=e−iHt∣Ψ(0)⟩$. Where $∣Ψ(t)⟩$ is the wave function at a time of t and H is the Hamiltonian. However, we have to remember that the decomposition of the Hamiltonian into Kronecker products of Pauli and identity matrices makes it easier to simulate this problem on a quantum computer. We also have to remember that the following inequality exists: $e^{−i(c_1 P_1 + c_2 P_2)t}\\neq e^{−i c_1 P_1 t} e^{−i c_2 P_2 t}$, where $P_i$ are the Pauli products that a Hamiltonian can be decomposed into and $c_i$ are the constants that scale these Pauli products appropriately (alternatively referred to as $h_{i,j,k}$). This is unfortunate because this would make calculations much easier for us and is the reason why we use Trotter decomposition. Trotter decomposition is implemented with the following approximation: $e^{−iHt}≈(Π_k e^{−ic_k P_k t/M})^M$. Here, $M$ is the Trotter number and this approximation becomes more accurate as $M$ increases.\n",
