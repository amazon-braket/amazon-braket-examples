    "[NVIDIA CUDA-Q](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/index.html) offers a unified programming model designed for hybrid workloads that run on CPUs, GPUs and QPUs. In this notebook, you will learn how to access the comprehensive application library provided by CUDA-Q. You will also learn how to write and run CUDA-Q programs on Amazon Braket devices, including both managed simulators and QPUs."

In the cell below, we define a kernel function called `bell_state` which creates a maximally-entangled two-qubit state. We then collect 1000 samples from this kernel, using the default simulator provided with CUDA-Q, to obtain a distribution of measurement probabilities.\n",
