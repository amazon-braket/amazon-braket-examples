    "# CUDA-Q with Braket Hybrid Jobs\n",
    "[NVIDIA CUDA-Q](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/index.html) offers a unified programming model designed for hybrid workloads that run on CPUs, GPUs and QPUs. In this notebook, you will learn how to run CUDA-Q programs using Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs. This notebook assumes basic knowledge of Hybrid Jobs. You can learn about Hybrid Jobs from [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-what-is-hybrid-job.html) in the Amazon Braket Developer Guide and the notebooks in [Amazon Braket Examples](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-examples/tree/main/examples/hybrid_jobs)."

    "After writing your CUDA-Q kernel and testing that your code works correctly, you can now move on to running your code as a Hybrid Job on an AWS-managed compute instance. This is great for scaling up to larger CPU-backed or GPU-backed instances or for parallelizing your workload over multiple instances, as demonstrated in subsequent example notebooks in this folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `@hybrid_job` decorator provides a convenient interface to submit a hybrid job, but it limits the availability of the source code to the inner functions defined in the decorator. The source code is critical for `@cudaq.kernel`. For more complex workloads, if you encounter an error related to source code availability, you can choose to submit a job without the `@hybrid_job` decorator and use `AwsQuantumJob.create` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a hybrid job using `AwsQuantumJob.create`, first you need to write your CUDA-Q program as a separate `.py` file. We will call this file the \"algorithm script\". For demonstration purposes, we have prepared an example algorithm script, `algorithm_script_getting_started.py`. Then, you can run the following code snippet to create the job. This interface of creating a hybrid job will not have any source code error. To learn more about creating hybrid job this way, you can read this [documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-first.html#braket-jobs-first-create) and this [example notebook](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-examples/tree/main/examples/hybrid_jobs/8_Creating_Hybrid_Job_Scripts)."
