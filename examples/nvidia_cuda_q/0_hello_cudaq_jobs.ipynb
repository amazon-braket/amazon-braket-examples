    "# Hello CUDA-Q with Braket Hybrid Jobs\n",
    "[CUDA-Q](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/index.html) offers a unified programming model designed for hybrid workloads that run on CPUs, GPUs and QPUs.

In the code snippet below, we run a Bell circuit on Braket SV1 using CUDA-Q and Braket Hybrid Jobs. When you finish testing on simulators and are ready to run experiments on QPUs, you can switch the target to Braket QPUs such as IQM, IonQ, and Rigetti devices by changing `device_arn` in the example below. The circuits run with a hybrid job receive higher-priority access to the target Braket QPUs, which not only reduces the runtime of your experiments but also minimizes the impact of hardware drift on your algorithms.

    "\n",
    "The `@hybrid_job` decorator provides a convenient interface to submit a hybrid job, but it limits the availability of the source code to the inner functions defined in the decorator. The source code is critical for `@cudaq.kernel`. For more complex workloads, if you encounter an error related to source code availability, you can choose to submit a job without the `@hybrid_job` decorator and use `AwsQuantumJob.create` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a hybrid job using `AwsQuantumJob.create`, first you need to write your CUDA-Q program as a separate `.py` file. We will call this file the \"algorithm script\". For demonstration purposes, we have prepared an example algorithm script, `algorithm_script_getting_started.py`. Then, you can run the following code snippet to create the job. This interface of creating a hybrid job will not have any source code error. To learn more about creating hybrid job this way, you can read this [documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-first.html#braket-jobs-first-create) and this [example notebook](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-examples/tree/main/examples/hybrid_jobs/8_Creating_Hybrid_Job_Scripts)."
