    "Besides creating a Braket Job programmatically using `AwsQuantumJob.create`, there is also an option to create a job in the Braket console. Follow [this link](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/braket/home#/job/create) to the \\\"Create job\\\" page. First, we need to give our new job a unique name. By default, Amazon Braket leverages the AmazonBraketJobsExecutionRole for your job to ensure all the necessary permissions to AWS resources exist during execution. The default S3 folder, where all inputs and outputs for your job are saved, follows the convention `amazon-braket-<region>-<account number>/jobs/<job-name>`. Amazon Braket will create the S3 bucket and folder on your behalf if it doesn't exist. You have the option to customize these defaults in the \\\"Advanced settings\\\" tab.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have created our first Braket Job with a simple batch of five circuits using the Amazon Braket SDK and, as an alternative, from the Braket console. We learned how to change the Amazon S3 folder and the AWS region for a job, and how to save results. We learned how to seamlessly change the device to run on simulators or QPUs. We used local mode to quickly test code. Finally, we created the same job using the Braket console."
