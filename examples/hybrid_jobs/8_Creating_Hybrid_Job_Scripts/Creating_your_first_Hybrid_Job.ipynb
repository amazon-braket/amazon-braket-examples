    "Besides creating a Braket Hybrid Job programmatically using `AwsQuantumJob.create`, there is also an option to create a hybrid job in the Braket console. Follow [this link](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/braket/home#/job/create) to the \\\"Create hybrid job\\\" page. First, we need to give our new hybrid job the algorithm script. The script can be uploaded directly from your computer in the console or selected from files that are uploaded to S3. Here you also have the option to provide input data and parameters to your algorithm. After the algorithm is specified, you have the option to skip directly to the review and create page.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have created our first Braket Job with a simple batch of five circuits using the Amazon Braket SDK and, as an alternative, from the Braket console. We learned how to change the Amazon S3 folder and the AWS region for a job, and how to save results, and how to retrieve queue depth for a device, and queue position for the hybrid job. We learned how to seamlessly change the device to run on simulators or QPUs. We used local mode to quickly test code. Finally, we created the same job using the Braket console."
