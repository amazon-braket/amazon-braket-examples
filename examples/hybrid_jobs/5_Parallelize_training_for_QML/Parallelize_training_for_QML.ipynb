    "Quantum machine learning (QML) is a special type of hybrid quantum-classical workload. Like classical machine learning (ML), there is usually a parameterized model, a dataset and a loss function. When training the model with the dataset, the parameters of the model are updated to minimize the loss function. In QML, the model contains one or many quantum circuits. The model may or may not also include classical neural nets. A loss function is usually defined for a single data point. Say a dataset $D$ has $N_D$ data points, $d_1$, $d_2$, ..., $d_{N_D}$. The losses associated with the data points are $L(d_1)$, $L(d_2)$, ..., $L(d_{N_D})$, where $L$ is the loss function. Without invoking any advanced feature, the algorithm script would compute these losses in serial, and then average them to be the total loss for gradient computations. This procedure is time consuming, especially when there are hundreds of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data parallelism\n",
    "The loss from one data point is independent of the other data points. The order of the loss evaluations therefore does not need to follow a specific order. They can even be evaluated <i>in parallel!</i> Losses and gradients of variational parameters associated with different data points can be evaluated on different GPUs at the same time. This is known as data parallelism. In this notebook, we will learn to use [SageMaker's distributed data parallel library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html) in Braket Jobs to accelerate the training of your quantum model. We go through examples to show you how to parallelize trainings across multiple GPUs in an instance, and even multiple GPUs over multiple instances! "

    "## Binary Classification of Sonar dataset\n",
    "Let's use a binary classification of the [Sonar dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar%2C+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29) as the QML example. The Sonar dataset contains 208 data points each with 60 features that are collected from sonar signals bouncing off materials. Each data point is either labeled as \"M\" for mines or \"R\" for rocks. Our QML model consists of an input layer, a quantum circuit and an output layer. The input and output layer are classical dense layers. The dimension of classical input layer is $60\\times N$, where $N$ is the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. The result of the input layer is encoded into the quantum circuit using [angle embedding](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.AngleEmbedding.html). After the angle embedding, the quantum circuit has the same structure as figure 4 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633). It is a generic circuit ansatz that has two parametrized [strongly entangling layers](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/user-docs-refactor/code/pennylane.templates.layers.StronglyEntanglingLayer.html) and a single parametrized rotation gate at the first qubit. The measurement is only performed at the first qubit. Using the concept of classical ML, the dimension of the quantum circuit layer is $N\\times1$. The classical output layer has dimension $1\\times1$ which takes the measurement of the quantum circuit and outputs a real number. The loss function is the [margin loss function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MarginRankingLoss.html) between the model output and the label. See [model_def.py](source_script/model_def.py) and [quantum_circuit.py](source_script/quantum_circuit.py) for more detail about the model and the quantum circuits."
