    "\n",
    "QAOA is a variational algorithm that uses parameterized quantum circuits to evaluate a classical cost function given by a binary optimization problem; the circuit parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize the cost function. The QAOA algorithm itself has different settings, such as circuit depth ($p$). In analogy to machine learning, these input settings are commonly referred to as _hyperparameters_. In the following, we show how to setup the problem, prepare input data and run QAOA using Braket Jobs.\n",

It has applications in theoretical physics and in combinatorial optimizations. To get started, we first create and visualize a random graph for the Max-Cut problem with <code>networkx</code> package. Feel free to adjust the number of nodes, <code>n</code>, and number of edges, <code>m</code> as part of your experiments."
