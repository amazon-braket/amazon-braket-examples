**************************
`Getting Started <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/hybrid_jobs/0_Getting_started/Getting_started.ipynb>`_
**************************

This tutorial shows how to run your first Amazon Braket Hybrid Job.

**************************
`Hyperparameter Tuning <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/hybrid_jobs/1_Hyperparameter_tuning/Hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb>`_
**************************

This notebook demonstrates a typical quantum machine learning workflow, including uploading data, monitoring training, and tuning hyperparameters.

**************************
`Using Pennylane with Braket Jobs <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/hybrid_jobs/2_Using_PennyLane_with_Braket_Jobs/Using_PennyLane_with_Braket_Jobs.ipynb>`_
**************************

In this tutorial, we use PennyLane within Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs to run the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a Max-Cut problem.

**************************
`Bring your own container <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/hybrid_jobs/3_Bring_your_own_container/bring_your_own_container.ipynb>`_
**************************

Amazon Braket has pre-configured containers for executing Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs, which are sufficient for many use cases involving the Braket SDK and PennyLane.
However, if we want to use custom packages outside the scope of pre-configured containers, we have the ability to supply a custom-built container. In this tutorial, we show how to use Braket Hybrid Jobs to train a quantum machine learning model using BYOC (Bring Your Own Container).
