Amazon Braket Python Schemas
====================

Amazon Braket Python Schemas is an open source library that contains the schemas for Braket, including:

* intermediate representations (IR) for Amazon Braket quantum tasks and offers serialization and deserialization of those IR payloads. Think of the IR as the contract between the Amazon Braket SDK and Amazon Braket API for quantum programs.
* schemas for the S3 results of each quantum task
* schemas for the device capabilities of each device

Here you'll find an overview and API documentation for Amazon Braket Python Schemas. The project homepage is in GitHub, https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-schemas-python, where you can find the source and installation instructions for the library.
