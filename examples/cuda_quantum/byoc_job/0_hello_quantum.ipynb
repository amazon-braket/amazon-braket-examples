    "[CUDA-Q](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/index.html) offers a unified programming model designed for a hybrid setting for CPUs and GPUs. In this notebook, you will learn how to run Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs with CUDA-Q using Bring Your Own Container (BYOC). BYOC enables you to configure the environment that you want to use in your jobs. This notebook assumes basic knowledge of Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs. You can learn about Hybrid Jobs from [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-what-is-hybrid-job.html) in the Amazon Braket Developer Guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, a docker container is built with CUDA-Q and other GPU related settings configured. The procedure for BYOC is presented in this page from [Braker Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-byoc.html). The required files for building a container with CUDA-Q are in the \"container\" folder, including\n",
    "- Dockerfile: Describes how the container is built.\n",
    "- requirements.txt: Additional Python dependencies to include.\n",
    "- braket_container.py: The start-up script of a job container (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "These files include basic settings to use CUDA-Q in jobs. You can modify these files to suit your need. For example, you can add more Python dependencies to \"requirements.txt\" and other dependencies to \"Dockerfile\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a shell script \"container_build_and_push.sh\" that automates the procedure of pulling, building and pushing container images. The shell script requires Docker to be installed on your local machine. If you don't have Docker already install, you can follow the [instruction in this page](https://www.docker.com/) to install it. The shell script takes two parameters:\n",
    "- image-name\n",
    "- region-name\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell script can be called with the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "container/container_build_and_push.sh <image-name> <region-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "When it's called, it will build a docker container and upload the container image to your [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repository. The container image will persist in your ECR repository until you update it. The arn of the image will take the format: `<aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<container-image-name>:latest`."
