    "# Quantum Monte Carlo on Quantum Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational chemistry and material science, we are often interested in finding the ground-state energy (i.e., minimum energy) of a molecule or solid for a given configuration of atomic positions. A range of different methods have been developed to solve the electronic structure problem; each with their own efficiency and accuracy tradeoffs. Important methods include mean-field approaches, such as Hartree-Fock theory (HF) and density functional theory (DFT), which can scale to large system sizes, but are not sufficiently accurate for strongly correlated systems. More sophisticated methods, such as coupled cluster theory (CC) or configuration interaction (CI) take electron correlations into account to achieve better accuracy. However, this comes at a high computational cost that makes it prohibitive to apply these methods to large systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [1] are a class of techniques that solve the electronic structure problem by applying probabilistic sampling of the target wavefunction. This sampling reduces the time and memory costs of the algorithm, but introduces an infamous 'sign-problem' that causes the variance of the sampled signal to grow exponentially with the system size. QMC methods include variational Monte Carlo (VMC), Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) and auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC). To improve the efficiency of sampling and mitigate the sign-problem, one can perform importance sampling using a trial state $|\\Psi_T\\rangle$ that approximates the true ground state. The ability of $|\\Psi_T\\rangle$ to approximate the target ground state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ thus determines the accuracy of the QMC calculation. Limitations of QMC on classical computers include the following:\n",
    "* The estimated ground state energy may have a large bias from the true energy.\n",
    "* The ground state energy may have a large statistical variance, due to the sign-problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to augment classical QMC calculations using quantum computers using AFQMC [2]. In particular, we discuss how quantum computers can be used to ameliorate the challenges discussed above. Compared to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) [3], a popular quantum algorithm for solving the electronic structure problem, QC‑AFQMC does not require an expensive optimization loop. The circuit depth of both methods is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized as follows. First, we provide theoretical background on how the AFQMC method works. Second, we show how quantum computers can be used to augment AFQMC calculations, explicitly showcasing the quantum subroutines using the PennyLane simulator in Amazon Braket. Finally, we present an example AFQMC calculation to find the ground state of H$_2$ molecule. The code can be run on both classical simulators and quantum computers.\n",

Since a direct implementation of the imaginary time evolution is difficult due to the two-body terms ($\\hat{v}^2_{\\gamma}$), the AFQMC algorithm maps the original interacting system onto an ensemble of non-interacting systems coupled to a set of random auxiliary fields $\\textbf{x}$ using the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation\n",

    "For a detailed derivation of the imaginary time evolution, we direct the reader to [Appendix B](#Appendix_B). Rather than analytically calculating the resulting integrals, AFQMC approximates the non-interacting imaginary time evolution by stochastically sampling the integral, and considering a finite ensemble of non-interacting states - known as walkers. The walker states will stay on the manifold of Slater determinant states during the imaginary time evolution. The evolution of every walker state is independent, which makes this step easily parallelizable. A schematic representation of the walkers propagating on the energy landscape to obtain the ground state energy is shown in the following picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/visualwalkers.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the introduction, the sampling of walkers can lead to the infamous sign problem, where the signal of QMC vanishes compared to the noise fluctuations. This sign problem is largely removed by a phaseless approximation [2] by using the trial state, which allows us to stochastically sample the walkers that are most prominent in the (approximate) ground state wavefunction. The quality of this approximation largely depends on the chosen trial wave function and may introduce a bias in the final converged energy estimate. This sampling is performed by evaluating the overlap integral and the corresponding energy between a walker and the trial state\n",

In the classical calculations implemented in this notebook, we will choose the trial state to be the HF state, e.g., $|\\Psi_C\\rangle = |\\Psi_{\\text{HF}}\\rangle$.\n",

    "How can we use quantum computers in the AFQMC algorithm? As we discussed earlier, the classical trial state $|\\Psi_C\\rangle$ is limited to a small class of states, i.e., either mean-field states (HF or DFT) or a linear combination of mean-field states. With quantum computers, we can choose from a much wider range of states $|\\Psi_T\\rangle = |\\Psi_Q\\rangle$, e.g., unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) -type states [3], which are believed to be exponentially hard to represent on classical computers. These quantum states could be obtained from a VQE pre-calculation.\n",

    "We can replace $|\\Psi_C\\rangle$ with $|\\Psi_Q\\rangle$ to perform a quantum-assisted QMC calculation [4,5]. Specifically we use new trial state when propagating the walkers and evaluating the energy, while the other steps in the algorithm are unchanged. To carry out the algorithm, we need to evaluate both the amplitude $\\langle\\Psi_Q|\\phi_l\\rangle$ and the local energy $\\langle\\Psi_Q|H|\\phi_l\\rangle$ for all walker states $|\\phi_l\\rangle$. Both quantities can be efficiently estimated on quantum computers using the vacuum reference circuit [5] shown below, where $V_T$ represents the unitary to prepare the $|\\Psi_Q\\rangle$ and $V_{\\phi}$ represents the unitary to prepare $|\\phi_l\\rangle$.\n",

    "### QAEE-AFQMC\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the eariler demonstration, in each step of the imaginary time evolution we need to execute several quantum circuits to estimate the overlaps and local energy for each walker state. This makes QC-AFQMC costly for both near-term quantum hardware and simulators. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach was suggested in [5] that only uses the quantum trial state $|\\Psi_Q\\rangle$ to evaluate the energy at the final stage of the algorithm, and performs purely classical AFQMC in all other steps of the algorithm. This approach is known as quantum-assisted energy evaluation (QAEE). The final energy is evaluated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = \\frac{\\sum_{l=1}^N w_l\\frac{\\langle \\Psi_Q|H|\\phi_l\\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi_C|\\phi_l\\rangle}}{\\sum_{l=1}^N w_l \\frac{\\langle \\Psi_Q|\\phi_l\\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi_C|\\phi_l\\rangle}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We carry out the QAEE calculation in the next two cells and find the ground state of H$_2$. Note that the walker states are propagated according to the classical trial state, and only the energy is evaluated using the quantum trial state. We select a few time steps to perform the energy evaluation to reduce the time cost. The results will demonstate the advantage of using a quantum trial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the quantum evaluations are only carried out on the times specified by `q_total_time`. If those times are not integer multiples of `dtau`, then the quantum step will never happen.\n",

    "\n",
    "With QAEE every fifty time steps, we can already see the benefit of QC-AFQMC. Now let's scale up AFQMC by increaing the number of quantum time steps in QAEE. With the increased number of time steps, the workload may take up to 30 minutes. For computationally intensive workloads like this one, we can leverage the managed experience of Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs. A Braket hybrid job starts a job instance on AWS to run the algorithm code in the background, and termimates the instance once the workload is done. Here, we use Braket Jobs to run the QC-AFQMC algorithm, and retrieve the logs and results of the computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first prepare the algorithm script in the `run_q_afqmc.py` file. In addition to the algorithm, we also define metrics to monitor and the results to save. The next cell creates a Braket job for QC-AFQMC calculation.\n",

    "<b>Note:</b> The following cell creates a Braket job for the QC-AFQMC calculation. The job will take about 30 mins on a ml.m5.24xlarge job instance, which will incur charge for about $2.8 USD.

    "In the plot of the computed ground-state energy of the H$_2$ molecule against imaginary time $\\tau$ above, the curve labeled \"classical\" denotes the ground-state energy computed by using the classical trial state, i.e., the Hartree-Fock state. The curve labeled \"quantum\" denotes the ground-state energy computed using the QAEE-AFQMC algorithm on the PennyLane Simulator. The black dashed line represents the true ground state energy. We see that both classical and quantum methods converge to the correct value. However, the energies computed using QAEE-AFQMC have a smaller variance, demonstrating one of the main benefits of this approach."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how classical algorithms for quantum Monte Carlo can be augmented with quantum hardware. We explored a variant of QMC, auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, which finds the ground state by performing a stochastic imaginary time evolution of an input state. This evolution is driven by computing the overlaps between a predefined trial state, and an ensemble of non-interacting walker states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a quantum device, we can use a more flexible trial state, which may provide a better approximation to the ground state. We illustrated how the overlaps between the quantum trial state and classical walker states can be evaluated using quantum devices that can be accessed with Amazon Braket. \n",
    "\n",
