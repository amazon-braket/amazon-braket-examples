    "Variational quantum algorithms, a specific form of hybrid algorithms, work in the very same way, using parametrized quantum circuits rather than parametrized neural networks and replacing the GPU with a QPU. \n",
    "Here, you start with an initial guess for the parameters that define your circuit, have the QPU execute that circuit, perform measurements to calculate an objective function, pass this value (together with the current values of the parameters) back to the CPU and have this *classical* CPU update the parameters based on that information. \n",

The TIM belongs to a the broader class of many-body spin systems that are inherently hard to study on classical computers as the dimension of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles in the system. With the help of a quantum computer, however, we can study these many-body systems with less overhead as the number of qubits required only grows polynomially. Even more so, the specific TIM is an integrable system and can be solved exactly, as shown in [7]. We will use these exact results as a benchmark for our approximate VQE results. \n",

    "__VQE ansatz__: VQE tries to find the lowest energy configuration of a given Hamiltonian, such as that of a chemical system or some many-body spin system (as studied here). Being a variational quantum-classical algorithm, VQE uses the QPU for state preparation and measurement subroutines, and the classical computer to post-process the measurement results and update the parametrized VQE ansatz according to an update rule such as gradient descent.\n",
    "VQE, however, does not come without limitations. \n",
    "Akin to what happens in deep learning, the quality of our results will depend very much on the trial architecture of our circuit (i.e., the trial wave function) and its the expressive power. \n",
    "In other words, to *approximate* the ground state we are looking for, VQE can only operate within the bounds of the general ansatz we are using (the so-called ansatz space), by having a quantum computer prepare this very ansatz state with a parameterized gate sequence, and then have a classical optimizer iteratively update the optimal parameters. \n",
    "Here, we will be guided by physical intuition and symmetry arguments to make an educated guess for our variational ansatz. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, VQE makes us of the variational principle, by preparing a parametrized trial wavefunction $\\left|\\Psi(\\vec{\\theta})\\right>$, and trying to find the optimal set of parameters $\\vec{\\theta}^{*}$, according to the following objective \n",

    "Since (for sufficiently large systems with more than $\\sim 50$ qubits) classical computers are unable to efficiently prepare, store and measure the wavefunction, we use the quantum computer for this subroutine. \n",
    "We then use the classical computer to iteratively update the parameters using some optimization algorithm [9].\n",

    "Therefore, we take our ansatz as a linear superposition of these two degenerate states, $\\left|\\psi(\\theta)\\right> = \\alpha \\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right> + \\beta R_{x}\\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right>$. How can we prepare such a state on a quantum computer? We use the following sequence of parametrized gates [10]: \n",

    "__Illustration__: Below, we illustrate our ansatz (as prepared by our method ```circuit```) with a circuit diagram for a small number of qubits $N$ and a fixed set of classical parameters. We print both our VQE ansatz as well as the modified circuit with a layer of single-qubit Hadamard gates ```H``` attached at the end, as needed to measure the $x$ projection with $\\sigma_{i}^{x}$ for all qubits. The latter is needed to compute the expectation value for the transverse field term $H_{B}=(B/2)\\sum_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{x}$. With this simple visualization we can convince ourselves that we have implemented the circuit ansatz as desired.  "

    "We are now ready to run some VQE simulation experiments. First of all, you can play and experiment yourself with the number of qubits $N$. Secondly, you may also experiment with the classical optimizer. Since we are using an off-the-shelf ```scipy``` minimizer (as described in more detail [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)), you can simply swap between different optimizers by setting the ```method``` parameter accordingly, as done above in the line ```result = minimize(..., method='SLSQP')```. Some popular options readily available within this library include *Nelder-Mead*, *BFGS* and *COBYLA*.    \n",
    "As a precautionary warning, note that the classical optimization step may get stuck in a local optimum, rather than finding the global minimum for our parametrized VQE ansatz wavefunction. \n",
    "To address this issue, we run several optimization loops, starting from different random parameter seeds. \n",
    "You can set the number of these optimization loops using the ```n_initial``` parameter, as shown below. \n",
    "While this brute-force approach does not provide any guarantee to find the global optimum, from a pragmatic point of view at least it does increase the odds of finding an acceptable solution, at the expense of potentially having to run many more circuits on the QPU.\n",
