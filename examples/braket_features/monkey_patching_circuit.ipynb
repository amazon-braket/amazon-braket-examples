    "In this notebook, we add customer capabilities to the Amazon Braket `Circuit` class by building custom functions to operate on quantum circuits defined in Braket's SDK. We use a technique called Monkey Patching to add those functions to Braket's `Circuit` class at runtime, thereby extending Braket's `Circuit` functionality. We work with two examples: a function we call `get_unitary()`, which returns the unitary matrix corresponding to a `Circuit` object, and a function called `adjoint()`, which returns a new circuit object corresponding to the conjugate transpose of the initial. The functions in the module are defined such that they act on `self`, and can be added to the `Circuit` class as methods. Amazon Braket already includes a method called `as_unitary()`, which allows us to compare the built-in functionality with our own added method.\n",

As of the time of writing, there are no built in methods in Braket's `Circuit` class to export the unitary matrix of a circuit object. Similarly, there are no methods to obtain the adjoint of a circuit. In order to overcome this challenge, we will define our own custom functions and monkey patch them onto the `Circuit` class."

This new circuit is constructed using custom unitaries, defined using the adjoint of the matrix of each gate in the original circuit. Thus, the output of `adjoint` is a circuit with many custom unitary gates. Such a circuit is well defined within the SDK, but the constituent gates may not be supported by all backends. For example, at the time of writing, neither the Rigetti QPU, nor the IONQ QPU support the `Unitary` gate. Thus, circuits generated using `adjoint` should be limited to simulators for the time being."

    "Consider a module `foo` containing a class `Bar`, which in turn has a set of methods, variables, etc. Suppose we wanted to add a method to `Bar` without directly editing the code of the class. We can do this by defining a new function `hello_world` somewhere else and _monkey patching_ the function onto `Bar` at runtime:\n",

    "Note that using a monkey patch to modify code at runtime can lead to undesired problems (see [[1]](#References) for additional details). Since monkey patching overwrites code at runtime, poorly implemented or poorly documented code can cause unexpected behavior. For instance, if the same code is monkey patched more than once, the most recent patch overwrites any earlier patches, which can cause problems if done unintentionally. Moreover, monkey patching can dramatically alter the behavior of code relative to the unpatched version, which can be problematic if the monkey patch is not properly documented. Finally, monkey patched code need not be updated along with the code it replaces, and as such updates to a module can break a patch (or vice versa)."
