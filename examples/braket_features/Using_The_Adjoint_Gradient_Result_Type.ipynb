    "A [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) refers to a vector derivative of a scalar-valued function of multiple variables.

The gradient is denoted $\\nabla$, so that $\\nabla f(x) = \\frac{df}{dx}$. However, if $f$ is a function of multiple variables, mapping $\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we must take partial derivatives with respect to each variable. For example:\n",

    "Gradients are of interest to us because many quantum algorithms -- hybrid classical-quantum algorithms such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) or the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) especially -- can be formulated as a problem of optimizing parameters (i.e. variables) in a quantum circuit with respect to some cost function, for example an expectation value of a Hamiltonian. To efficiently perform this optimization it's common to use a gradient based optimization method, such as gradient descent (stochastic or not). An efficient means of computing gradients allows us to arrive at a good solution to the optimization problem in fewer circuit evaluations, and thus less cost."

    "Now we can see how using the `AdjointGradient` result type can improve performance for a hybrid algorithm such as QAOA. For an introduction to QAOA, see [its example notebook](../hybrid_quantum_algorithms/QAOA/QAOA_braket.ipynb). We'll modify the `train` function to use `AdjointGradient` and determine a Jacobian, and compare this approach with the Jacobian-free method used in the QAOA notebook. Much of the code here is further explained in that notebook, so we strongly suggest you review it before proceeding. We'll run the entire QAOA workflow in `shots=0` mode so that we can compare with `AdjointGradient`, which means we can directly compute the cost (energy). First, we set up the problem and import the circuit generator and training functions:"
