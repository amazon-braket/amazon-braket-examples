    "\n",
    "The new local simulator is available as a Python package, [`amazon-braket-simulator-v2`](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-simulator-v2-python). You can install it locally with `pip`. You should `import braket.simulator_v2` as well to install all the backend dependencies. Then, all you need to do is create a `LocalSimulator` object with the `\"braket_sv_v2\"` (state vector) or `\"braket_dm_v2\"` backend names to use the new local simulator. The new local simulator supports qubit counts up to 32 (state vector) or 16 (density matrix). Keep in mind larger qubit counts require more memory!"

    "\n",
    "We already presented the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in [the QFT notebook](../advanced_circuits_algorithms/Quantum_Fourier_Transform/Quantum_Fourier_Transform.ipynb). These circuits have a mix of one- and two-qubit gates so we can compare the efficiency of each simulator's implementation. We will simulate the measurement counts for these circuits on both local simulators. The older local simulator can only simulate up to 18 or so qubits for state-vectors, but the new one can work with substantially more. In this case we will not run up to 32 qubits on the new simulator, because the memory use can become quite substantial. 25 qubits is enough to see that the new simulator can outperform the existing default."
