    "Adjoint differentiation is a technique used to compute gradients of parametrized quantum circuits. It can be used when `shots=0` and is available on Amazon Braket's on-demand state vector simulator, SV1. The adjoint differentiation method allows you to compute the gradient of a circuit with `P` parameters in only 1+1 circuit executions (one forward and one backward pass, similar to backpropagation), as opposed to the parameter-shift or finite-difference methods, both of which require `2P` circuit executions for every gradient calculation. The adjoint method can lower the cost of running variational quantum workflows, especially for circuits with a large number of parameters."

We'll also set the number of active electrons to simulate. Active electrons are those which can transition between energy levels through an excitation: single, double, or more. Including more active electrons will increase the number of qubits we need to simulate this molecule. In this tutorial, we will set the number of active electrons to `8` - less than the 22 total electrons present in $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. In practice, it's usually possible to get accurate results using far fewer active electrons than total electrons in the molecule, as most electrons do not participate in bonding.\n",

    "We'll need to set up the device to use with PennyLane. Because the qubit count is 16, this workflow is a good candidate for SV1, the Amazon Braket on-demand state vector simulator. SV1 now supports two gradient computation methods in `shots=0` (exact) mode: adjoint differentiation, available by setting `diff_method='device'`, and parameter shift, available by setting `diff_method='parameter-shift'`. As shown in [the adjoint gradient example notebook](../../braket_features/Using_The_Adjoint_Gradient_Result_Type.ipynb), the adjoint differentiation method is an execution-frugal way to compute gradients. When using `parameter-shift`, each partial derivative in the gradient requires *two* circuit executions to compute, but with the adjoint method we can compute *all* partial derivatives (and thus the entire gradient) with one circuit execution and the \"back-stepping\" procedure, which is similar in runtime. The adjoint method can deliver a quadratic speedup in the number of parameters, making it a great choice when the number of parameterized gates is large, as it is for our problem."

    "Above, we mentioned that the adjoint differentiation method (accessible through the `diff_method='device'` argument to a PennyLane `qnode`) should be used in `shots=0` mode because it offers quadratic speedup over the `parameter-shift` method. However, `parameter-shift` is easily parallelizable using batch execution, which is supported by the Amazon Braket PennyLane plugin (see [the docs](https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/braket_remote.html#enabling-the-parallel-execution-of-multiple-circuits) for more), while the adjoint method must run in a single quantum task.
