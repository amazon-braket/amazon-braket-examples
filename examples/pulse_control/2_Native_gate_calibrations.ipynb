    "# Accessing the pulse implementation of native gates\n",
    "All gates are implemented with a sequence of pulses that is carefully calibrated by quantum hardware providers. In this notebook, we will show how to:\n",
    "- retrieve the calibrations for any particular native gate of interest, \n",
    "- modify it \n",
    "- submit a circuit where we will overwrite the provider's calibrations and use our modified ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "These calibrations will be vended as `PulseSequence` objects and will contain a list of low-level instructions that are played in place of the gate that you inserted. Obtaining the accurate sequence that used by the provider offers many opportunities. First, it is one of the best way to understand how quantum computers works at the most fundamental layer. It also allows you to improve the results of your circuits by deploying error mitigation techniques such as zero noise extrapolation by stretching all the pulse of specific gates.\n",
