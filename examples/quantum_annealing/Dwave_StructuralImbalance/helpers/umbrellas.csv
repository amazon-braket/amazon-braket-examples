At its peak, the organization had 40,000 to 70,000 fighters, and represented the largest alliance of opposition forces that has existed in the Syrian conflict. However, the organization’s constituent groups drifted apart in mid-2014 due to disagreements between the Islamic Front’s most powerful members: Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam. The umbrella group is now defunct, although Liwa al-Tawhid and other former Islamic Front battalions briefly referred to themselves as an independent group known as the Islamic Front before forming the Levantine Front in the Aleppo governorate.","2013-11-22","2014-06-00",,"IF"

The SIF did not  come under the command of the Free Syrian Army’s Supreme Military Council (SMC), but it regularly coordinated military maneuvers with SMC affiliated brigades. In January 2013, Ahrar al-Sham absorbed three smaller SIF groups (Harakat al-Fajr al-Islamiya, Jamaat al-Taliaa al-Islamiya, and Kataeb al-Iman al-Muqatila) and became the SIF’s largest member.

"33","Popular Mobilization Forces","The Popular Mobilization Forces is a state-sponsored organization composed of roughly forty Shiite militias that was formed by the Iraqi Government on June 15, 2014 in order to work alongside the Iraqi Armed Forces fighting the Islamic State (IS). The organization appears to be led by the commanders of three of its largest member groups: Qais al-Khazali of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis of Kata'ib Hezbollah, and Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization. The Popular Mobilization Units were heavily involved in the Iraqi Army's offensive to retake Tikrit from IS in March 2015 and have subsequently been active in the Anbar province. However, the Iraq government has announced that the organization will not participate in the anticipated battle to retake Mosul from IS; many sources attribute this decision the sectarian killings of Sunni Iraqis purportedly perpetrated by members of the Popular Mobilization Forces during its previous campaigns in majority Sunni areas. While this umbrella organization has been active in Iraq, there have been no confirmed operations by this group in Syria. ","2014-06-15","0000-00-00",,
