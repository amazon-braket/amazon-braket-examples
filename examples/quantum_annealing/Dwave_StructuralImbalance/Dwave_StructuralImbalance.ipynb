Such networks are said to be __structurally balanced__ when they can be cleanly divided into two sets, with each set containing only friends, and all relations between these sets are hostile. The measure of __structural imbalance__ or __frustration__ for a signed social network, when it cannot be cleanly divided, is the minimum number of edges that violate the social rule, “the enemy of my friend is my enemy.”\n",
