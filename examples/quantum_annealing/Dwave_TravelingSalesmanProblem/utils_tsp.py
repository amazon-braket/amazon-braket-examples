def traveling_salesperson(
    G, sampler=None, lagrange=None, weight="weight", start=None, **sampler_args
):
    """Returns an approximate minimum traveling salesperson route.

    Defines a QUBO with ground states corresponding to the
    minimum routes and uses the sampler to sample
    from it.

    A route is a cycle in the graph that reaches each node exactly once.
    A minimum route is a route with the smallest total edge weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph on which to find a minimum traveling salesperson route.
        This should be a complete graph with non-zero weights on every edge.

    sampler :
        A binary quadratic model sampler. A sampler is a process that
        samples from low energy states in models defined by an Ising
        equation or a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
        Problem (QUBO). A sampler is expected to have a 'sample_qubo'
        and 'sample_ising' method. A sampler is expected to return an
        iterable of samples, in order of increasing energy. If no
        sampler is provided, one must be provided using the
        `set_default_sampler` function.

    lagrange : number, optional (default None)
        Lagrange parameter to weight constraints (visit every city once)
        versus objective (shortest distance route).

    weight : optional (default 'weight')
        The name of the edge attribute containing the weight.

    start : node, optional
        If provided, the route will begin at `start`.

    sampler_args :
        Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns
    -------
    route : list
       List of nodes in order to be visited on a route

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import dimod
    ...
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from({(0, 1, .1), (0, 2, .5), (0, 3, .1), (1, 2, .1),
    ...                            (1, 3, .5), (2, 3, .1)})
    >>> dnx.traveling_salesperson(G, dimod.ExactSolver(), start=0) # doctest: +SKIP
    [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Notes
    -----
    Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
    function does not attempt to confirm the quality of the returned
    sample.
