    "# Using quantum annealing on Amazon Braket for price optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial Optimization is one of the most important fields in optimization. Practical applications can be found in virtually every industry. Prominent examples include supply chain optimization in transport and logistics, portfolio management in finance, and the optimization of clinical trials in healthcare, among many others. It is also one of the most active research topics in operation research and computer science. However, many practical combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard and require massive computation costs to find solution of good quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how a quantum annealer on Amazon Braket can be used for price optimization taking into consideration the trade-off between maximizing revenue and minimizing risk. We show how to formulate this problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO) and use the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer on Amazon Braket to find close-to-optimal solutions. Overall, this notebook demonstrates that customers can easily leverage quantum computing through Amazon Braket to solve difficult combinatorial optimization challenges in their daily decision-making process."

    "Amazon Braket provides access to quantum annealers from D-Wave Systems Inc. which are specifically designed to solve QUBO problems. A quantum annealer is a hardware implementation of Quantum Annealing (QA) which is a generic algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems by taking advantage of quantum fluctuations to escape local minima in complex energy landscapes by effect of tunnelling through barriers separating local minima [5].  Through a simple Amazon Braket API call, the formatted QUBO problem can be embedded to the hardwired topology of the machine and submitted to machine. In turn, the quantum annealer performs an annealing process and obtains a result. However, because of the sparsity of the underlying chip, one typically faces a certain overhead in embedding the original QUBO problem to the D-Wave hardware, because (typically) one logical binary variable maps onto several physical qubits, in order to effectively distill the connectivity of the original QUBO problem. For more details, we refer to the Amazon Braket tutorial notebook available here (https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/quantum_annealing/Dwave_Anatomy.ipynb)."

We plot the distribution of the energies of all the 823,543 possible solutions as shown below, where the red line represents our optimized result obtained from the quantum annealer.

    "We can see from the plot below that there is a Pareto front [11] where the expected revenue cannot be increased without increasing the standard deviation (i.e. uncertainties), and the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the expected revenue can vary significantly between 10000 and 13500, while the estimated standard deviation of the revenue (i.e. uncertainty) can change in a large range $[200,380]$ as well. The figure shows that as the expected revenue increases, the estimated standard deviation of the revenue will also increase. This means that if we select a price solution for higher expected revenue, the uncertainties will increase at the same time indicating that the demand estimation model will become less confident about its predictions. This illustrates there is a trade-off between maximizing the revenue and minimizing the uncertainty. High revenue and rewards usually accompany with high uncertainties and risk. In practice, according to different business strategies and needs, we usually need to find an appropriate $\\beta$ to maximize the revenue under an acceptable level of uncertainty."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to leverage a quantum annealer on Amazon Braket to solve a price optimization use case. We showed how to mathematically formulate the problem within the (quantum-ready) QUBO framework, and then subsequently solve the optimization problem on a D-Wave quantum annealer. Our results are promising in terms of both close-to-optimal quality and computational efficiency. Since the QUBO formalism is a generalized framework that can embrace a variety of combinatorial optimization use cases (e.g. scheduling/planning, routing, portfolio management), the proposed solution can be arguably adapted and recycled by customers across other multiple industries. Already today our customers can get quantum-ready, and easily leverage Amazon Braket to help solve their daily combinatorial optimization challenges, and make better business and operation decisions."
