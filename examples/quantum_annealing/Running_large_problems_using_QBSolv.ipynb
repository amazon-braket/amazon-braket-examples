    "To solve a problem with a D-Wave QPU, one defines the problem in QUBO (or Ising) form. Owing to the limited qubit connectivity in D-Wave devices, the source graph given by the QUBO (or Ising) problem must be mapped to the target graph of the underlying hardware following a process called minor embedding. For the D-Wave 2000Q device with a Chimera graph, there is no guarantee to find an embedding for a problem with more than 64 variables; for the Advantage devices with a Pegasus graph, the upper limit for an arbitrary problem is around 145. However, some real-world problems may require more variables than a QPU can support. To solve large problems with the D-Wave devices, you can use `QBSolv()`, which is offered by the Ocean SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "`QBSolv()` is a hybrid solver that can decompose large QUBO problems into sub-problems. The sub-problems are solved using either both the QPU and a classical Tabu solver, or the classical solver alone. The solution to the problem is then constructed by the results of the sub-problems. More details can be found in the D-Wave documentation [here](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/qbsolv/en/latest/).\n",
