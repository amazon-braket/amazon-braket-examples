    "==============================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we provide an overview of the **Blackbird quantum programming language**. This\n",
    "simple and elegant language breaks down a quantum circuit into a set of instructions detailing the\n",
    "quantum operations we would like to apply, as well as the the subsystems that these operations act\n",
    "on. The Blackbird language is built-in to Strawberry Fields, but also exists as a separate\n",
    "Python [package](https://quantum-blackbird.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "----------\n",

    "Blackbird is a quantum assembly language, capable of representing the basic continuous-variable (CV)\n",
    "states, gates, and measurements outlined in the [Introduction to quantum photonics](https://strawberryfields.ai/photonics/concepts/photonics.html#introduction) page. Collectively, these are all\n",
    "considered as *Operations*. In Blackbird, there are four main types of Operations:\n",

    "* State preparation\n",

    "* Gate application\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding and removing subsystems\n",
    "\n",
    "These all use the following general syntax: ``Operation(args) | q``, where ``args`` represents a list of parameters for the operation, and ``q`` is the qumode (or sequence of qumodes) the quantum operation acts upon. In Blackbird code, the symbol ``|`` *always* separates the operation to be applied (on the left) and the subsystem(s) it acts on (on the right).\n",

    "State preparation\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "States can be prepared using the state preparation Operators [``Vacuum``](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/strawberryfields.ops.Vacuum.html), [``Fock``](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/strawberryfields.ops.Fock.html), [``Coherent``](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/strawberryfields.ops.Coherent.html), [``Squeezed``](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/strawberryfields.ops.Squeezed.html), [``DisplacedSqueezed``](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/strawberryfields.ops.DisplacedSqueezed.html), and [``Thermal``](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/strawberryfields.ops.Thermal.html).
