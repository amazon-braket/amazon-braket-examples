    "# Getting Started with Error Mitigation with mitiq on Braket \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at `mitiq`, a python library for performing quantum error mitigation, in tandem with performance features from Amazon Braket. In subsequent notebooks, we show to utilize mitiq with Amazon Braket, specifically focusing on utilizing Program Sets to orchestrate job submissions, reducing costs and improving accuracies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need error mitigation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A key characteristic of realistic quantum systems is the rate at which they couple to external environment. Thus, unitary evolutions couple with bath environment resulting in information loss or distortion in the system of interest. In digital quantum computing, we can understand this as errors affecting our simulation. Thus the most trustworthy approach is to correct these errors, which in principle can be done using so called quantum error correction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fully quantum error corrected schemes are not here however, and so we can instead try to mitigate errors or harness the noisy signal within a noisy quantum system, up to the decay time of our system. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques attempts to do just this, similar to improving the signal-to-noise ratio of a noisy signal, generally at the cost of repeated measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum error mitigation, or just error mitigation, can be defined as tools or techniques which can reduce or *mitigate* the effect of quantum errors in a system, using approaches without active feedback. That is, extra copies of states can be used, and post processing channels applied to a system, in order to improve the quality of a result, but we do not allow for active feedback. This has helped to theoretically define the limits of quantum error mitigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The cost of error mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Error mitigation techniques have been shown to have a fundamentally exponential scaling for unbiased results. That is, to correct all error for arbitrary input states requires an exponential amount of resources. This exponential requirement is present in the variance of the estimation, which naively scales as $e^{\\lambda \\times IF \\times N}$, where $N$ is the number of relevant gates, $IF$ is some limiting gate infidelity, and $\\lambda$ relates to the method. Probabilistic error cancellation for instance, is lower bounded by $\\lambda = 4$, while zero-noise extrapolation can reach $\\lambda = 2$, and post-selection, $\\lambda = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We include multiple references at the end for the interested reader. Importantly, this cost is reduced based on the quality of the method, the depth of the gates, and the limiting gate fidelities, generally a two qubit error rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is critical to know what is worth spending more time and executions on. Utilizing ProgramSets is only half the battle - by batching we can generally reduce costs, seeing up to 100x decreases in cost, but we also want to be aware of where our variances are coming from, and that we have allocated our resources accordingly. This is a challenging task, and generally can vary depending on problems, circuits, devices, and mitigation techniques.\n",

    "### Using mitiq and Braket\n",
    "\n",
    "mitiq is an open source Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques, which covers a breadth of different methodoloies and tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mitiq library provides numerous error mitigation approaches as pre-implemented strategies. These include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readout error mitigation (`mitiq.rem`)\n",
    "- Zero noise extrapolation (`mitiq.zne`)\n",
    "- Probabilistc Error Cancellation (`mitiq.pec`)\n",
    "- Probabilistic Error Amplification (`mitiq.pea`)\n",
    "- Pauli Twirling (`mitiq.pt`)\n",
    "- Robust Shadow Estimation (`mitiq.rse`)\n",
    "- Quantum Subspace Expansions for Stabilizers (`mitiq.qse`)\n",
    "- Clifford Data Regression (`mitiq.cdr`)\n",
    "- Virtual Distillation (`mitiq.vd`)\n",
    "- Digital Dynamical Decopuling (`mitiq.ddd`)\n",
    "\n",
    "and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Patterns in mitiq\n",
    "\n",
    "mitiq contains two methods for applying error mitigation generally. The first can be thought of as a simple function call which passes a Circuit and scalars. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from mitiq.zne import execute_with_zne\n",
    "zne_result = execute_with_zne(circuit, executor, *args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second unpacks this procedure, separating the creation of circuits and their application and reassembly:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from mitiq.zne import construct_circuits, combine_results\n",
    "modified_circuits = construct_circuits(circuit)\n",
    "raw_data = executor(modified_circuits)\n",
    "zne_result = combine_results(raw_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the `mitiq_braket_tools.py` file, we develop a `braket_mitiq_executor` function which can easily be used with the first pattern, and meets the requirements of a `mitiq.executor.Executor` object. The second we will explore more in a future notebook, and is develop in the parent `tools` folder, i.e. in the `tools/program_set_tools.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further details can be found at https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Verbatim circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of these approaches, we will want to treat our circuits using the Verbatim box. This creates a more reliable thread between the submitted circuits and the noise structure which is being treated, and also allows us to skip the Braket service compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, given a circuit of interest, we may: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass our circuit through a compiler / transpiler to nativize it\n",
    "2. Pass our circuit through mitiq to create copies or multiple instances\n",
    "3. Run our circuits on the Braket service using Verbatim compilation \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will use the qiskit-braket-provider to harness the Qiskit transpiler, though alternatively the Braket compiler can be used as well by submitting a job to the service against a compiler and returning the output circuit. \n"
