    "### Readout error mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Readout errors occur largely due to challenges in performing projective or POVM measurements on a device, which heavily depend on the hardware used and relevant physics and/or timescales. Readout error mitigation, or REM, specifically focuses on correcting these errors. Because of the ubiquity of the problem and the prevalance of superconducting devices, many schemes historically have focused on SC devices. However, different mitigation schemes may be better suited for device types, which some architectures having very high readout fidelities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the device, within a static circuit (i.e. a traditional circuit model), we only have a single layer of measurements, and thus even largely high readout error rates can be permitted at the cost of a constant shot overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most [common way](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/rem-5-theory.html) of performing readout error mitigation is to (1) characterize the confusion matrix $C$ of relevant input state and output states, (2) calculate the inverse of this matrix, $C^{-1}$ and then (3) apply the inverse to your measurement results (which w.l.o.g. can be cast as an array) to obtain some error mitigated results. Each of these steps can involve some technical challenges at scale, which we detail below. The [mitiq REM](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/rem.html) page contains numerous useful references related to REM. \n",
    "\n",
    "An optional step, which is utilized in Mitiq, is to (4) constrain the modified distribution to the closest probability distribution, using `scipy`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note on post-selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-selection is also a very common, physically motived error mitigation approach (also relevant to quantum error detection approaches, as in [McArdle et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02467), [Cai et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00921), [Sagastizabal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11258)). We can equivalently cast $C$ as some projector $C_P$, where $P$ is a set of bit-strings that obey particle symmetries. $C$ is not invertible, but we can still consider it as a sort of filter applied to measurement results. Mitiq does [support post-selection](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/rem-1-intro.html#apply-postselection) as well. "

    "\n",
    "We can further simplify the above procedure somewhat by considering a variant of the readout procedure. ***In brief***, we randomize the output measurement channel, and thus remove our input state dependence, reducing $2^n$ input states to 1. This is similar to ideas in [Hashim et al.](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.6.010307), though [earlier works](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.105.032620) have also used twirling in measurements. The main difference here is in the application of the inverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement POVM in the computational basis can be written as $M_i = \\frac{1}{2}(I_i \\pm Z_i)$. The measurement channel itself has the form $\\mathcal{E}[\\rho] = M_0 \\rho M_0 + M_1 \\rho M_1$. We can effectively \"twirl\" the measurement operation by inserting Pauli gates before (physically) and after (virtually). For a measurement channel, this will yield an effective bitflip channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference here is the cost of learning - in a single configuration we can now learn all the symmetrized transition coefficients to precision $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Another way to think of this is that most states have similar transition rates from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

This is essentially because the inverse matrix has a norm larger than the identity, i.e. you are expanding some contractive stochastic mapping. From [previous work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14044), we can see that the variance for a tensor product of single qubit probabilities increases the variance by:\n",

The additional factor of $\\gamma$ is due to the fact that it itself functionally depends on $\\hat p_i$, and has a related propagation of error. Thus, to suppress this, we would ideally learn the noise with $\\gamma^2 N$ shots. \n",
