    "## Getting started with error mitigation with Mitiq on Braket \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at [Mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a python library for performing quantum error mitigation, in tandem with performance features from Amazon Braket for quantum computational applications. In subsequent notebooks, we show how to utilize Mitiq with Amazon Braket, specifically focusing on utilizing program sets to orchestrate job submissions, reducing costs and improving accuracies for quantum jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need error mitigation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic quantum systems couple to external environments. These interactions can result in information loss or distortion of the system of interest. In digital quantum computing, we can understand this simply as errors affecting our simulation (for instance, bit-flip or phase errors), and the strength of the interaction typically translates to the frequency or strength of noise. In principle, given certain error rates, we can use tools from quantum error correction to fully correct, these errors, but these are beyond the capabilities of systems today. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can instead try to mitigate errors or harness the noisy signal within a noisy quantum system, up to the decay time of our system. Quantum error mitigation (QEM, see [Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00921)) techniques attempts to do just this, similar to improving the signal-to-noise ratio of a noisy signal, generally at the cost of repeated measurements. We define quantum error mitigation, or just error mitigation, as tools or techniques which can reduce or *mitigate* the effect of quantum errors in a system, using approaches *without active feedback*. That is, extra copies of states can be used, and post processing channels can be applied to a system, but we do not allow for active feedback. This has helped to theoretically define the limits of quantum error mitigation (see [Takagi et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00618-z)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The cost of error mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Error mitigation techniques have been shown ([Takagi et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00618-z), [Quek et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02536-7)) to have a fundamentally exponential scaling to obtain unbiased results. That is, to correct all error for arbitrary input states requires an exponential number of shots. This exponential requirement is present in the variance of the estimation, which naively scales as $e^{\\lambda \\times IF \\times N}$, where $N$ is the number of relevant gates, $IF$ is some limiting gate infidelity, and $\\lambda$ relates to the method. Probabilistic error cancellation for instance, is lower bounded by $\\lambda = 4$, while zero-noise extrapolation can reach $\\lambda = 2$, and post-selection, $\\lambda = 1$ ([Aharanov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17243)). \n",
    "\n",
    "We include multiple references at the end for the interested reader. Importantly, this cost is reduced based on the quality of the method, the depth of the gates, and the limiting gate fidelities, generally a two qubit error rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is critical to know what is worth spending more time and executions on. Utilizing program sets is only half the battle - by batching we can generally reduce costs, seeing up to 100x decreases in cost, but we also want to be aware of where our variances are coming from, and that we have allocated our resources accordingly. This is a challenging task, and generally can vary depending on problems, circuits, devices, and mitigation techniques.\n",

    "### Using Mitiq and Braket\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitiq is an open-source Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques, which covers a breadth of different methodologies and tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Mitiq library provides numerous error mitigation approaches as pre-implemented strategies. These include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readout error mitigation (`mitiq.rem`)\n",
    "- Zero-noise extrapolation (`mitiq.zne`)\n",
    "- Probabilistic Error Cancellation (`mitiq.pec`)\n",
    "- Probabilistic Error Amplification (`mitiq.pea`)\n",
    "- Pauli Twirling (`mitiq.pt`)\n",
    "- Classical Shadows (`mitiq.shadows`)\n",
    "- Quantum Subspace Expansions for Stabilizers (`mitiq.qse`)\n",
    "- Clifford Data Regression (`mitiq.cdr`)\n",
    "- Virtual Distillation (`mitiq.vd`)\n",
    "- Digital Dynamical Decoupling (`mitiq.ddd`)\n",
    "\n",
    "and more. See the [documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide.html) for a full list of supported methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Patterns in Mitiq\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitiq contains two methods for applying error mitigation generally. The first can be thought of as a simple function call in which one passes a Circuit and the QEM technique parameters into a function `mitiq.xyz.execute_with_xyz`. This uses an [`executor`](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/executors.html) object, which is detailed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from mitiq.zne import execute_with_zne\n",
    "zne_result = execute_with_zne(circuit, executor, *args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second unpacks this procedure, separating the creation of circuits and their execution and reassembly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from mitiq.zne import construct_circuits, combine_results\n",
    "modified_circuits = construct_circuits(circuit)\n",
    "raw_data = executor(modified_circuits)\n",
    "zne_result = combine_results(raw_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the `mitiq_braket_tools.py` file, we show executors which can easily be used with the first pattern, and meets the requirements of a `mitiq.executor.Executor` object. The second we will explore more in a future notebook, and is develop in the parent `tools` folder, i.e. in the `tools/program_set_tools.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further details can be found in the [Mitiq guide](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Verbatim circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of these approaches, we will want to treat our circuits using the [Verbatim box](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-openqasm-verbatim-compilation.html). This creates a more reliable thread between the submitted circuits and the noise structure which is being treated, and also allows us to skip the Braket service compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, given a circuit of interest, we may: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass our circuit through a compiler / transpiler to nativize it\n",
    "2. Pass our circuit through Mitiq to create copies or multiple instances\n",
    "3. Run our circuits on the Braket service using Verbatim compilation \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will use the [Qiskit-Braket provider](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider/tree/main) to harness the Qiskit transpiler, though alternatively the Braket compiler can be used as well by submitting a job to the service against a compiler and returning the output circuit. \n"

Generally, error mitigation allows us to reliably expand what is possible on today's quantum computers, and can help deliver more reliable and useful results for noisy quantum devices. \n",
