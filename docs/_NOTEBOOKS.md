-  [**Running quantum circuits on simulators**](examples/getting_started/1_Running_quantum_circuits_on_simulators/1_Running_quantum_circuits_on_simulators.ipynb) [(RQCS)](#index_RQCS)

<a name="RQCS"></a>

  This tutorial prepares a paradigmatic example for a multi-qubit entangled state, the so-called GHZ state (named after the three physicists Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger). The GHZ state is extremely non-classical, and therefore very sensitive to decoherence. For this reason, it is often used as a performance benchmark for today's hardware. Moreover, in many quantum information protocols it is used as a resource for quantum error correction, quantum communication, and quantum metrology.

<a name="RQCQ"></a>

  This tutorial prepares a maximally-entangled Bell state between two qubits, for classical simulators and for QPUs. For classical devices, we can run the circuit on a local simulator or a cloud-based on-demand simulator. For the quantum devices, we run the circuit on the superconducting machine from Rigetti, and on the ion-trap machine provided by IonQ. As shown, one can swap between different devices seamlessly, without any modifications to the circuit definition, by re-defining the device object. We also show how to recover results using the unique Amazon resource identifier (ARN) associated with every quantum task. This tool is useful if you must deal with potential delays, which can occur if your quantum task sits in the queue awaiting execution.

Superdense coding is a method of transmitting two classical bits by sending only one qubit. Starting with a pair of entanged qubits, the sender (_aka_ Alice) applies a certain quantum gate to their qubit and sends the result to the receiver (_aka_ Bob), who is then able to decode the full two-bit message.

  This tutorial provides a detailed implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and the inverse QFT, using the Amazon Braket SDK. We provide two different implementations: with and without recursion. The QFT is an important subroutine to many quantum algorithms, most famously Shor's algorithm for factoring, and the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. The QFT can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, using only O(n<sup>2</sup>) single-qubit Hadamard gates and two-qubit controlled phase shift gates, where ùëõ is the number of qubits. We first review the basics of the quantum Fourier transform, and its relationship to the discrete (classical) Fourier transform. We then implement the QFT in code two ways: recursively and non-recursively. This notebook also showcases the Amazon Braket `circuit.subroutine` functionality, which allows one to define custom methods and add them to the Circuit class.

Moreover, eigenvalue problems can be found across many disciplines and application areas, including (for example) principal component analysis (PCA) as used in machine learning, or in the solution of differential equations as relevant across mathematics, physics, engineering and chemistry. We first review the basics of the QPE algorithm. We then implement the QPE algorithm in code using the Amazon Braket SDK, and we illustrate the application of the algorithm with simple examples. This notebook also showcases the Amazon Braket `circuit.subroutine` functionality, which allows you to use custom-built gates as if they were any other built-in gates. This tutorial is set up to run on the local simulator or the on-demand simulator. Changing between these devices requires changing only one line of code, as demonstrated below in cell.

Hybrid workloads usually consist of iterations of quantum circuit executions and variational parameter optimizations. By using embedded simulators, we keep all computations in the same environment. This allows the optimization algorithm to access advanced features supported by the embedded simulator.

<a name="CGPPL"></a>

  In this tutorial, we explore how to speed up training of quantum circuits by using parallel execution on Amazon Braket. We begin by discussing why quantum circuit training involving gradients requires multiple device executions and motivate how the Braket SV1 simulator can be used to overcome this. The tutorial benchmarks SV1 against a local simulator, showing that SV1 outperforms the local simulator for both executions and gradient calculations. This illustrates how parallel capabilities can be combined between PennyLane and SV1.

  In this tutorial we dig deeper into how quantum circuit training can be applied to a problem of practical relevance in graph optimization. We show how easy it is to train a QAOA circuit in PennyLane to solve the maximum clique problem on a simple example graph. The tutorial then extends to a more difficult 20-node graph and uses the parallel capabilities of the Amazon Braket SV1 simulator to speed up gradient calculations and hence train the quantum circuit faster, using around 1-2 minutes per iteration.

The PennyLane device resource tracker keeps a record of the usage of a device, such as numbers of circuit evaluations and shots.

The device tracker can be combined with additional logic to monitor and limit resource usage on devices.

-  [**Adjoint Gradient Computation**](examples/pennylane/6_Adjoint_gradient_computation/6_Adjoint_gradient_computation.ipynb) [(AGC)](#index_AGC)

<a name="AGC"></a>

  In this tutorial, we will show you how to compute gradients of free parameters in a quantum circuit using PennyLane and Amazon Braket. Adjoint differentiation is a technique used to compute gradients of parametrized quantum circuits. It can be used when shots=0 and is available on Amazon Braket‚Äôs on-demand state vector simulator, SV1. The adjoint differentiation method allows you to compute the gradient of a circuit with P parameters in only 1+1 circuit executions (one forward and one backward pass, similar to backpropagation), as opposed to the parameter-shift or finite-difference methods, both of which require 2P circuit executions for every gradient calculation. The adjoint method can lower the cost of running variational quantum workflows, especially for circuits with a large number of parameters.
