The adjoint differentiation method allows you to compute the gradient of a circuit with P parameters in only 1+1 circuit executions (one forward and one backward pass, similar to backpropagation), as opposed to the parameter-shift or finite-difference methods, both of which require 2P circuit executions for every gradient calculation.
