# Braket Examples

Welcome to the primary repository for Amazon Braket examples and tutorials. Learn how to *build*, *test*, and *run* quantum circuits and programs using Amazon Braket with simulators and quantum hardware. Introductory examples on a variety of topics are included, as well as more canonical quantum algorithms. You also can find information on utilizing particular devices or using Amazon Braket with other supported tools. 

> [!TIP]
> For those who are just getting started with Amazon Braket, see the [Getting Started](#new) examples and the [Amazon Skill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/introducing-the-amazon-braket-learning-plan-and-digital-badge/) learning plan. The [Amazon Braket Algorithm Library](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-algorithm-library/tree/main) also contains detailed examples and preimplemented algorithms.
