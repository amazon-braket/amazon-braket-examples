> [!TIP]
> For those who are just getting started with Braket, we also recommend the [Amazon Skill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/introducing-the-amazon-braket-learning-plan-and-digital-badge/). For further examples and implemented algorithms, please see the [Amazon Braket Algorithm Library](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-algorithm-library/tree/main) repository. 

>[!NOTE]
> Amazon Braket provides managed jupyter notebook instances which can be run on the cloud and accessed anywhere! To run these locally, the dependences can be installed [following the instructions](#dependencies) below.
