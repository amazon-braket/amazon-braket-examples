# Braket Examples

Welcome to the primary repository for Amazon Braket examples and tutorials! Here you can see examples of how to *build*, *test*, and *run* quantum circuits and programs using Amazon Braket with simulators and quantum hardware.

> [!TIP]
> For those who are just getting started with Braket, see the [Getting Started](#new) folder and the [Amazon Skill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/introducing-the-amazon-braket-learning-plan-and-digital-badge/). The [Amazon Braket Algorithm Library](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-algorithm-library/tree/main) also contains detailed examples and preimplemented algorithms. 

>[!NOTE]
> Amazon Braket provides [managed Jupyter notebook instances](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) which can be run on the cloud and accessed anywhere! To run the examples locally, the dependences can be installed [following the instructions](#dependencies) below.
