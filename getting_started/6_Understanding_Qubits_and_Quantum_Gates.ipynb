Two possible basis states for a qubit are the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ - as represented in [_Bra-Ket or Dirac notation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation). The state of the qubit is a unit vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space and the two basis states are represented as : \n",
