Coroutines
==========

.. testsetup::

   from tornado import gen

**Coroutines** are the recommended way to write asynchronous code in
Tornado. Coroutines use the Python ``await`` keyword to
suspend and resume execution instead of a chain of callbacks
(cooperative lightweight threads as seen in frameworks like `gevent
<http://www.gevent.org>`_ are sometimes called coroutines as well, but
in Tornado all coroutines use explicit context switches and are called
as asynchronous functions).

Coroutines are almost as simple as synchronous code, but without the
expense of a thread.  They also `make concurrency easier
<https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html>`_ to reason
about by reducing the number of places where a context switch can
happen.

Example::

    async def fetch_coroutine(url):
        http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
        response = await http_client.fetch(url)
        return response.body

Native vs decorated coroutines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.5 introduced the ``async`` and ``await`` keywords (functions
using these keywords are also called "native coroutines"). For
compatibility with older versions of Python, you can use "decorated"
or "yield-based" coroutines using the `tornado.gen.coroutine`
decorator.

Native coroutines are the recommended form whenever possible. Only use
decorated coroutines when compatibility with older versions of Python
is required. Examples in the Tornado documentation will generally use
the native form.

Translation between the two forms is generally straightforward::

    # Decorated:                    # Native:

    # Normal function declaration
    # with decorator                # "async def" keywords
    @gen.coroutine
    def a():                        async def a():
        # "yield" all async funcs       # "await" all async funcs
        b = yield c()                   b = await c()
        # "return" and "yield"
        # cannot be mixed in
        # Python 2, so raise a
        # special exception.            # Return normally
        raise gen.Return(b)             return b

Other differences between the two forms of coroutine are outlined below.

- Native coroutines:

  - are generally faster.
  - can use ``async for`` and ``async with``
    statements which make some patterns much simpler.
  - do not run at all unless you ``await`` or
    ``yield`` them. Decorated coroutines can start running "in the
    background" as soon as they are called. Note that for both kinds of
    coroutines it is important to use ``await`` or ``yield`` so that
    any exceptions have somewhere to go.

- Decorated coroutines:

  - have additional integration with the
    `concurrent.futures` package, allowing the result of
    ``executor.submit`` to be yielded directly. For native coroutines,
    use `.IOLoop.run_in_executor` instead.
  - support some shorthand for waiting on multiple
    objects by yielding a list or dict. Use `tornado.gen.multi` to do
    this in native coroutines.
  - can support integration with other packages
    including Twisted via a registry of conversion functions.
    To access this functionality in native coroutines, use
    `tornado.gen.convert_yielded`.
  - always return a `.Future` object. Native
    coroutines return an *awaitable* object that is not a `.Future`. In
    Tornado the two are mostly interchangeable.

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains the operation of decorated coroutines. Native
coroutines are conceptually similar, but a little more complicated
because of the extra integration with the Python runtime.

A function containing ``yield`` is a **generator**.  All generators
are asynchronous; when called they return a generator object instead
of running to completion.  The ``@gen.coroutine`` decorator
communicates with the generator via the ``yield`` expressions, and
with the coroutine's caller by returning a `.Future`.

Here is a simplified version of the coroutine decorator's inner loop::

    # Simplified inner loop of tornado.gen.Runner
    def run(self):
        # send(x) makes the current yield return x.
        # It returns when the next yield is reached
        future = self.gen.send(self.next)
        def callback(f):
            self.next = f.result()
            self.run()
        future.add_done_callback(callback)

The decorator receives a `.Future` from the generator, waits (without
blocking) for that `.Future` to complete, then "unwraps" the `.Future`
and sends the result back into the generator as the result of the
``yield`` expression.  Most asynchronous code never touches the `.Future`
class directly except to immediately pass the `.Future` returned by
an asynchronous function to a ``yield`` expression.

How to call a coroutine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coroutines do not raise exceptions in the normal way: any exception
they raise will be trapped in the awaitable object until it is
yielded. This means it is important to call coroutines in the right
way, or you may have errors that go unnoticed::

    async def divide(x, y):
        return x / y

    def bad_call():
        # This should raise a ZeroDivisionError, but it won't because
        # the coroutine is called incorrectly.
        divide(1, 0)

In nearly all cases, any function that calls a coroutine must be a
coroutine itself, and use the ``await`` or ``yield`` keyword in the
call. When you are overriding a method defined in a superclass,
consult the documentation to see if coroutines are allowed (the
documentation should say that the method "may be a coroutine" or "may
return a `.Future`")::

    async def good_call():
        # await will unwrap the object returned by divide() and raise
        # the exception.
        await divide(1, 0)

Sometimes you may want to "fire and forget" a coroutine without waiting
for its result. In this case it is recommended to use `.IOLoop.spawn_callback`,
which makes the `.IOLoop` responsible for the call. If it fails,
the `.IOLoop` will log a stack trace::

    # The IOLoop will catch the exception and print a stack trace in
    # the logs. Note that this doesn't look like a normal call, since
    # we pass the function object to be called by the IOLoop.
    IOLoop.current().spawn_callback(divide, 1, 0)

Using `.IOLoop.spawn_callback` in this way is *recommended* for
functions using ``@gen.coroutine``, but it is *required* for functions
using ``async def`` (otherwise the coroutine runner will not start).

Finally, at the top level of a program, *if the IOLoop is not yet
running,* you can start the `.IOLoop`, run the coroutine, and then
stop the `.IOLoop` with the `.IOLoop.run_sync` method. This is often
used to start the ``main`` function of a batch-oriented program::

    # run_sync() doesn't take arguments, so we must wrap the
    # call in a lambda.
    IOLoop.current().run_sync(lambda: divide(1, 0))

Coroutine patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calling blocking functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest way to call a blocking function from a coroutine is to
use `.IOLoop.run_in_executor`, which returns
``Futures`` that are compatible with coroutines::

    async def call_blocking():
        await IOLoop.current().run_in_executor(None, blocking_func, args)

Parallelism
^^^^^^^^^^^

The `.multi` function accepts lists and dicts whose values are
``Futures``, and waits for all of those ``Futures`` in parallel:

.. testcode::

    from tornado.gen import multi

    async def parallel_fetch(url1, url2):
        resp1, resp2 = await multi([http_client.fetch(url1),
                                    http_client.fetch(url2)])

    async def parallel_fetch_many(urls):
        responses = await multi ([http_client.fetch(url) for url in urls])
        # responses is a list of HTTPResponses in the same order

    async def parallel_fetch_dict(urls):
        responses = await multi({url: http_client.fetch(url)
                                 for url in urls})
        # responses is a dict {url: HTTPResponse}

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

In decorated coroutines, it is possible to ``yield`` the list or dict directly::

    @gen.coroutine
    def parallel_fetch_decorated(url1, url2):
        resp1, resp2 = yield [http_client.fetch(url1),
                              http_client.fetch(url2)]

Interleaving
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes it is useful to save a `.Future` instead of yielding it
immediately, so you can start another operation before waiting.

.. testcode::

    from tornado.gen import convert_yielded

    async def get(self):
        # convert_yielded() starts the native coroutine in the background.
        # This is equivalent to asyncio.ensure_future() (both work in Tornado).
        fetch_future = convert_yielded(self.fetch_next_chunk())
        while True:
            chunk = await fetch_future
            if chunk is None: break
            self.write(chunk)
            fetch_future = convert_yielded(self.fetch_next_chunk())
            await self.flush()

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

This is a little easier to do with decorated coroutines, because they
start immediately when called:

.. testcode::

    @gen.coroutine
    def get(self):
        fetch_future = self.fetch_next_chunk()
        while True:
            chunk = yield fetch_future
            if chunk is None: break
            self.write(chunk)
            fetch_future = self.fetch_next_chunk()
            yield self.flush()

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

Looping
^^^^^^^

In native coroutines, ``async for`` can be used. In older versions of
Python, looping is tricky with coroutines since there is no way to
``yield`` on every iteration of a ``for`` or ``while`` loop and
capture the result of the yield. Instead, you'll need to separate the
loop condition from accessing the results, as in this example from
`Motor <https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_::

    import motor
    db = motor.MotorClient().test

    @gen.coroutine
    def loop_example(collection):
        cursor = db.collection.find()
        while (yield cursor.fetch_next):
            doc = cursor.next_object()

Running in the background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an alternative to `.PeriodicCallback`, a
coroutine can contain a ``while True:`` loop and use
`tornado.gen.sleep`::

    async def minute_loop():
        while True:
            await do_something()
            await gen.sleep(60)

    # Coroutines that loop forever are generally started with
    # spawn_callback().
    IOLoop.current().spawn_callback(minute_loop)

Sometimes a more complicated loop may be desirable. For example, the
previous loop runs every ``60+N`` seconds, where ``N`` is the running
time of ``do_something()``. To run exactly every 60 seconds, use the
interleaving pattern from above::

    async def minute_loop2():
        while True:
            nxt = gen.sleep(60)   # Start the clock.
            await do_something()  # Run while the clock is ticking.
            await nxt             # Wait for the timer to run out.
