What's new in Tornado 1.2.1
===========================

    We are pleased to announce the release of Tornado 1.2.1, available from
    https://github.com/downloads/facebook/tornado/tornado-1.2.1.tar.gz

    This release contains only two small changes relative to version 1.2:
    * FacebookGraphMixin has been updated to work with a recent change to the
      Facebook API.
    * Running "setup.py install" will no longer attempt to automatically
      install pycurl.  This wasn't working well on platforms where the best way
      to install pycurl is via something like apt-get instead of easy_install.

    This is an important upgrade if you are using FacebookGraphMixin, but
    otherwise it can be safely ignored.
