Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an case in which the `.Future` returned by
  `.RequestHandler.finish` could fail to resolve.
- The `.TwitterMixin.authenticate_redirect` method works again.
- Improved error handling in the `tornado.auth` module, fixing hanging
  requests when a network or other error occurs.
