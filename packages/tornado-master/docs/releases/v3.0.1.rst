What's new in Tornado 3.0.1
===========================

Apr 8, 2013
-----------

* The interface of `tornado.auth.FacebookGraphMixin` is now consistent
  with its documentation and the rest of the module.  The
  ``get_authenticated_user`` and ``facebook_request`` methods return a
  ``Future`` and the ``callback`` argument is optional.
* The `tornado.testing.gen_test` decorator will no longer be recognized
  as a (broken) test by ``nose``.
* Work around a bug in Ubuntu 13.04 betas involving an incomplete backport
  of the `ssl.match_hostname` function.
* `tornado.websocket.websocket_connect` now fails cleanly when it attempts
  to connect to a non-websocket url.
* ``tornado.testing.LogTrapTestCase`` once again works with byte strings
  on Python 2.
* The ``request`` attribute of `tornado.httpclient.HTTPResponse` is
  now always an `~tornado.httpclient.HTTPRequest`, never a ``_RequestProxy``.
* Exceptions raised by the `tornado.gen` module now have better messages
  when tuples are used as callback keys.
