===========================

Nov 24, 2012
------------

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a memory leak in ``tornado.stack_context`` that was especially likely
  with long-running ``@gen.engine`` functions.
* `tornado.auth.TwitterMixin` now works on Python 3.
* Fixed a bug in which ``IOStream.read_until_close`` with a streaming callback
  would sometimes pass the last chunk of data to the final callback instead
  of the streaming callback.
