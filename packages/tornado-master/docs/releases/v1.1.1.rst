What's new in Tornado 1.1.1
===========================

Feb 8, 2011

::

    Tornado 1.1.1 is a BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE security update that fixes an
    XSRF vulnerability.  It is available at
    https://github.com/downloads/facebook/tornado/tornado-1.1.1.tar.gz

    This is a backwards-incompatible change.  Applications that previously
    relied on a blanket exception for XMLHTTPRequest may need to be modified
    to explicitly include the XSRF token when making ajax requests.

    The tornado chat demo application demonstrates one way of adding this
    token (specifically the function postJSON in demos/chat/static/chat.js).

    More information about this change and its justification can be found at
