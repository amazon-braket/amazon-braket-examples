What's new in Tornado 3.1.1
===========================

Sep 1, 2013
-----------

* `.StaticFileHandler` no longer fails if the client requests a ``Range`` that
  is larger than the entire file (Facebook has a crawler that does this).
* `.RequestHandler.on_connection_close` now works correctly on subsequent
  requests of a keep-alive connection.
