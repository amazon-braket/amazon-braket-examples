What's new in Tornado 3.0.2
===========================

Jun 2, 2013
-----------

* `tornado.auth.TwitterMixin` now defaults to version 1.1 of the
  Twitter API, instead of version 1.0 which is being `discontinued on
  June 11 <https://dev.twitter.com/calendar>`_.  It also now uses HTTPS
  when talking to Twitter.
* Fixed a potential memory leak with a long chain of `.gen.coroutine`
  or ``gen.engine`` functions.
