    "In this tutorial we show how to (approximately) solve binary combinatorial optimization problems, using the __Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)__, as introduced [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). \n",
    "The QAOA algorithm belongs to the class of __hybrid quantum algorithms__ (leveraging both classical as well as quantum compute), that are widely believed to be the working horse for the current __NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era__.\n",
    "To validate our approach we benchmark our results with exact results as obtained from classical QUBO solvers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a step-by-step walkthrough explaining the QAOA quantum algorithm and show how to build the corresponding parametrized quantum circuit ansatz using the ```Braket``` SDK, with simple modular building blocks (that can be re-used for other purposes). \n",
    "We use open-source off-the-shelf ```scipy``` optimizers for classical numerical optimization. \n",
    "While we demonstrate our proof-of-concept approach using classical simulators for circuit execution, our code could in principle be run on actual quantum hardware by simply changing the definition of the ```device``` object (provided that the gate set used in the ansatz is supported by the backend, as is the case here for IonQ; for Rigetti we need to apply one more extra trick as shown below).

    "Since we are using an off-the-shelf ```scipy``` minimizer (as described in more detail [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)), you can simply swap between different optimizers by setting the ```method``` parameter accordingly, as done above in the line ```result = minimize(..., method='SLSQP')```. \n",
    "Some popular options readily availbale within this library include *Nelder-Mead*, *BFGS* and *COBYLA*. \n",
    "As a precautionary warning, note that the classical optimization step may get stuck in a local optimum, rather than finding the global minimum for our parametrized QAOA ansatz wavefunction. \n",
    "To address this issue, we may run several optimization loops, starting from different random parameter seeds. \n",
    "While this brute-force approach does not provide any guarantee to find the glocal optimum, from a pragmatic point of view at least it does increase the odds of finding an acceptable solution, at the expense of potentially having to run many more circuits on the QPU."
